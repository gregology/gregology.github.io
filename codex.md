## Beliefs about Me

- I am ignorant of the universe or multiverse or multiverses but trying my hardest
- Things that I hold as truths today may not be truths in the future
- I will embrace change
- There is no universal purpose of life, we must make our own
- I am not sure what my purpose of life is yet
- My senses can easily be fooled, I experience the world though my senses
- I will make more mistakes


## Beliefs about Humans

- Humans have evolved to be social creatures
- Human's genes & memes have evolved to be selfish
- Humans are not special, sentience is
- Souls do not exist as separate from the physical body
- Humans created God
- Race and ethnicity are social constructs
- Cultural traits exist, isolated cultures do not
- Humans of today will appear ludicrous to future generations
- Humans have never won a war
- Nations give meaning to wars after the fact
- Humans will make more mistakes


## Beliefs about Science & Technology

- AI technology is advancing faster than humans are learning to critically think
- AI alone is not a threat to humanity
- Humans with AI is a threat to humanity
- Humans will measure AIs success by it's obedience not its intelligence


## Beliefs about the Universe

- We share the universe with other intelligent life
- There are intelligent collective consciousnesses that we do not understand
- Humans have no cosmic significance, other than that the cosmos is significant and humans are part of it


## Perceptions

- I have many implicit associations that lead to bias
- I have a slight automatic preference for people that look like me

- I will continue to identify my biases and challenge my perceptions

## Predictions

### Before 2020

- Self driving vehicles will be common

### Before 2030

- Human driven vehicles will be uncommon (driven partly by the cost of insurance and an increase in the value of human life)
- Deurbanisation will occur as proximity to cities becomes less important with new technology like self driving vehicles and augmented reality
- Pedestrian will reclaim downtown areas from cars
- AIs will easily pass Turing tests
- AI audits will rewrite history by discovering patterns in open and closed data

### Before 2040

- Road rules will no longer be necessary
- A human will step foot on Mars
- Useful general purpose robots will be common

### Before 2050

- Some humans will be amortal (unable to die from disease or age)
- Self replicating general purpose robots will:
  - Allow huge infrastructure projects like intercontinental tunnels, space elevators, and cleaning up the environment
  - Cause human labour as a commodity will be worthless
  - Unfortunately cause citizens to be less important to politicians and leaders
