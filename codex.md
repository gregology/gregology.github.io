By defining my beliefs & principles I can recognise when my actions misalign. When this inevitably occurs, I will *consciously* decide whether to alter my actions or my Codex Vitae. This public document is an invitation to others to hold me accountable to my commitments and to help me identify contradictions.

## Predictions

### Before 2020

- ~~Self driving vehicles will be common (1% of inner city traffic my home town of Ottawa)~~
  - 🔴 Failed: It seems I was too optimistic in 2017 about the state of self driving technology
- ~~Traffic will be dramatically reduced by the small number of vehicles using traffic aware navigation (Uber drivers, self driving cars, delivery trucks, etc)~~
  - 🔴 Failed: When an accident occurs on the highway, myself and a small cohort of other traffic aware navigators take the last available exit before the accident, follow some country roads, and then rejoin the highway after accident. However the affect seems fairly limited as the vast majority of drivers still do not use traffic aware navigation
- ~~Humans will develop new common language to discuss recent populism (bubbled advocates, post-truth politics, etc)~~
  - 🟠 Mostly failed: New language exists but it is not common

### Before 2023

- ~~Fast satellite internet will be affordable in Canada (300Mbps⬆️⬇️for $150CAD per month)~~
  - 🔴 Failed: Starlink has a $140 service with advertised speeds of up to 200Mbps. However in realitity the service provides median speeds of 66⬆️/9⬇️ Mbps in Canada  

### Before 2025

- Self driving vehicles (level 3) will be common on highways (1% of traffic on the 401)

  - 🟢 Success: In 2023 large language models like ChatGPT 4 can pass the turing test in all but a few edge cases
- AI audits will rewrite history by discovering patterns in open & closed data
- Biometric tracking will allow for early detection of communicable diseases greatly reducing their transmission potential & prevalence
- Critical thinking skills will improve as legacy media fades (alternatively the world will be destroyed by trolls)

- At least one of the Detroit Big Three (Ford, GM, & Chrysler) will fail to adapt and be acquired or go bankrupt
- The majority of information accessible and accessed on the Internet will be generated by large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT
