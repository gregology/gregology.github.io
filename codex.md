By consciously defining my beliefs and principles I can recognise when my actions and thoughts misalign. When this inevitably occurs, I will consciously alter my actions or update this Codex Vitae. This public document is an invitation to others to hold me accountable to my beliefs and commitments.

## Beliefs about Me

- I am ignorant
- Today's beliefs may not be tomorrow's beliefs
- My emotions are my responsibility
- I will continue to change
- There is no universal purpose of life, we must make our own
- I am not sure what my purpose of life is yet
- My senses can easily be fooled, I experience the world though my senses
- I make mistakes


## Beliefs about Humans

- Humans have evolved to be social creatures
- Human's genes & memes have evolved to be selfish
- Humans are not special, sentience is
- Souls do not exist as separate from the physical body
- Humans created God
- Race and ethnicity are social constructs
- Cultural traits exist, cultures do not
- Today's humanity will appear ludicrous to future generations
- Armies & governments win & lose in war, civilians & soldiers only lose in war
- Nations give meaning to wars after the fact
- Plants & animals domesticated humans
- Humans will make more mistakes


## Beliefs about Science & Technology

- AI is already causing huge societal changes
- AI alone is not a threat to humanity
- Humans misusing AI is a threat to humanity
- As AI evolves, we must be careful to measure sentience by intelligence not obedience
- All scientific models are wrong but some are useful


## Beliefs about the Universe

- We share the universe with other intelligent life
- There are intelligent collective consciousnesses that we do not understand
- Humans have no cosmic significance, other than that the cosmos is significant and humans are part of it
- In a casual universe, nobody is irrational


## Perceptions

- I have many implicit associations that lead to bias
- I have a slight automatic preference for people that look like me
- I am susceptible to many cognitive biases and logical fallacies
- I will continue to identify my biases and challenge my perceptions


## Principles

*In order of importance*

- Think objectively
- Do not judge
- Maximise sentience fulfilment
- Minimise sentience distress


## Predictions

### Before 2020

- Self driving vehicles will be common

### Before 2030

- Human driven vehicles will be uncommon (driven partly by the cost of insurance and an increase in the value of human life)
- Deurbanisation will occur as proximity to cities becomes less important with new technology like self driving vehicles and augmented reality
- Pedestrian will reclaim downtown areas from cars
- AIs will easily pass Turing tests
- AI audits will rewrite history by discovering patterns in open and closed data

### Before 2040

- Road rules will no longer be necessary
- A human will step foot on Mars
- Useful general purpose robots will be common

### Before 2050

- Some humans will be amortal (unable to die from disease or age)
- Self replicating general purpose robots will:
  - Allow huge infrastructure projects like intercontinental tunnels, space elevators, and cleaning up the environment
  - Cause human labour as a commodity will be worthless
  - Unfortunately cause citizens to be less important to politicians and leaders
