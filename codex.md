By defining my beliefs and principles I can recognise when my actions misalign. When this inevitably occurs, I will *consciously* decide whether to alter my actions or my Codex Vitae. This public document is an invitation to others to hold me accountable to my commitments.

- AI audits will rewrite history by discovering patterns in open and closed data

### Before 2040

### Before 2050

- Some humans will be amortal (unable to die from disease or age)
- Self replicating general purpose robots will:
  - Allow huge infrastructure projects like intercontinental tunnels, space elevators, and cleaning up the environment
  - Cause human labour as a commodity will be worthless
  - Unfortunately cause citizens to be less important to politicians and leaders
