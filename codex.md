By defining my beliefs & principles I can recognise when my actions misalign. When this inevitably occurs, I will *consciously* decide whether to alter my actions or my Codex Vitae. This public document is an invitation to others to hold me accountable to my commitments and to help me identify contradictions.

- Traffic will be dramatically reduced by the small number of vehicles using traffic aware navigation (Uber drivers, self driving cars, delivery trucks, etc)

- Deurbanisation will occur as proximity to cities becomes less important with new technology like self driving vehicles and augmented reality
- Pedestrian will reclaim downtown areas from cars

- AI audits will rewrite history by discovering patterns in open & closed data
- Biometric tracking will allow for early detection of communicable diseases greatly reducing their transmission potential & prevalence

### Before 2040

- Road rules will no longer be necessary
- A human will step foot on Mars
- Useful general purpose robots will be common
- Humans will be augmented to the point that they refer to their tools in the first person

### Before 2050

- Some humans will be amortal (unable to die from disease or age)
- Self replicating general purpose robots will:
