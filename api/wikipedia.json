This includes the bombing of military forces, railways, harbors, cities (civilian areas), and industrial areas. <br />\n<br />\nIn 1939, many cities, including the Polish capital, [[Warsaw]], fell victim to an indiscriminate and unrestricted [[Bombing of Warsaw in World War II|aerial bombardment campaign]] by the German [[Luftwaffe]].&lt;ref&gt;Levine 1992, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=LZ99c7ZlxxQC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=bombing+of+poland&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MWYnVPUYV5&amp;sig=jvqXwmmXzimwb2bxpv6KzQExxIs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=a8QmSv7rG6G-NOiXyYQF&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8 p. 21]&lt;/ref&gt; As the war continued to expand, bombing by both [[Axis powers|Axis]] and [[Allies|Allied]] powers increased significantly. While military and industrial were targeted, extensive bombing was also used as a psychological weapon intended to break an enemy's will to fight. In 1940–1941, this characterized Germany's [[The Blitz|Blitz campaign]] against the [[United Kingdom]],  which failed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray 1983, p. 52&quot;/&gt;<br />\n<br />\nFrom 1942 onward, the intensity of the British bombing campaign increased steadily and became [[Area bombing directive|less restrictive]], increasingly targeting civilian areas in addition to industrial and military targets.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings 1979&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrett 1993&quot;&gt;Garrett 1993{{pn}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. air forces significantly reinforced these efforts beginning in 1943. By 1944, the Western Allies had utilized their bomber fleet to devastating effect on targets inside Germany, with Allied bomb tonnage dropped on Germany far surpassing that dropped on the United Kingdom by the ''Luftwaffe''.&lt;ref&gt;Boog 2001, p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the enormously greater effort, [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]] had a limited effect on German industrial production, and had no more success in breaking Germany's will to fight than the ''Luftwaffe'' had against the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrett 1993&quot;/&gt; <br />\n<br />\nIn the Pacific theatre, U.S. strategic bombing of the Japanese Empire began in earnest in October 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Pimlott, John. ''B-19 Superfortress'' (London: Arms and Armour Press, 1980), p.40.&lt;!--better than nothing...--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, small-scale attacks out of China had been hampered by the need to deliver supplies over the [[Himalayas|Himalaya]] foothills (known as [[The Hump|&quot;The Hump&quot;]]), as well as by enormous Chinese graft.{{Definition|date=September 2009}}. Missions out of [[Saipan]] escalated into widespread fire-bombing, which culminated in the 1945 [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].<br />\n<br />\n== Legal considerations ==<br />\n{{Main|Aerial bombardment and international law}}<br />\nThe [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions]], which address the codes of wartime conduct on land and at sea, were adopted before the rise of air power. Despite repeated diplomatic attempts to update [[international humanitarian law]] to include aerial warfare, it was not updated before the outbreak of World War II. The absence of specific international humanitarian law did not mean aerial warfare was not covered under the [[laws of war]], but rather that there was no general agreement of how to interpret those laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gómez|first=Javier Guisández|date=20 June 1998|title=The Law of Air Warfare|journal=[[International Review of the Red Cross]]|volume=nº 323|pages=347–63|url=http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/iwpList200/42F64C9A4212EA07C1256B66005C0BF1}}&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\n== Europe ==<br />\n===Policy at the start of the war===<br />\nWhen the war began on 1 September 1939, [[Franklin D.

Bombing was to be &quot;focused on the morale of the enemy civil population and in particular of the industrial workers.&quot; Factories were no longer targets.&lt;ref&gt;Levine 1992, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\nThe effects of strategic bombing were very poorly understood at the time and grossly overrated. Particularly in the first two years of the campaign, few understood just how little damage was caused and how rapidly the Germans were able to replace lost production—despite the obvious lessons to be learned from the United Kingdom's own survival of the blitz.<br />\n<br />\nMid-way through the air war, it slowly began to be realized the campaign was having very little effect. Despite an ever-increasing tonnage of bombs dispatched, the inaccuracy of delivery was such any bomb falling within ''five miles'' of the target was deemed a &quot;hit&quot; for statistical purposes, and even by this standard, as the [[Butt Report]] made clear many bombs missed.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Hank (2003).

He felt that as much as it would be far more desirable to deliver effective pin-point attacks, as the capacity to do so simply did not exist, and since it was war, it was necessary to attack with whatever was at hand.  He accepted area bombing knowing it would kill civilians.<br />\n<br />\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1979-025-19A, Braunschweig, Kinderleichen nach Luftangriff.jpg|thumb|left|An elderly lady in front of the bodies of school children in [[Braunschweig]], Germany, after a bombing raid]]<br />\n<br />\nDuring the first few months of the area bombing campaign, an internal debate within the British government about the most effective use of the nation's limited resources in waging war on Germany continued.  Should the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) be scaled back to allow more resources to go to the [[British Army]] and [[Royal Navy]] or should the [[Strategic Bombing During World War II|strategic bombing]] option be followed and expanded? An influential paper was presented to support the bombing campaign by Professor [[Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell]], the British government's leading scientific adviser, justifying the use of area bombing to &quot;[[dehousing|dehouse]]&quot; the German workforce as the most effective way of reducing their morale and affecting enemy war production.&lt;ref&gt;Levine 1992, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\nMr. Justice Singleton, a High Court Judge, was asked by the Cabinet to look into the competing points of view. In his report, that was delivered on 20 May 1942, he concluded that &quot;If Russia can hold Germany on land I doubt whether Germany will stand 12 or 18 months’ continuous, intensified and increased bombing, affecting, as it must, her war production, her power of resistance, her industries and her will to resist (by which I mean morale)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Longmate 1983,p.133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Copp 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valourandhorror.com/BC/Issues/Singletn.php Issues : Singleton - World War Two]&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, thanks in part to the dehousing paper, it was this view which prevailed and Bomber Command would remain an important component of the British war effort up to the end of World War II.  A very large proportion of the industrial production of the United Kingdom was harnessed to the task of creating a vast fleet of heavy bombers—so much so other vital areas of war production were under-resourced. Until 1944, the effect on German production was remarkably small and raised doubts whether it was wise to divert so much effort &amp;ndash; the response being there was no where else the effort could have been applied to greater effect.<br />\n<br />\nThe disruption of the German transportation system was extensive. Despite German efforts to minimize loss of industrial productivity through dispersal of production facilities, as well as the extensive use of [[slave labour]], the Nazi regime experienced a decline in the ability to supply [[materiel]]. Furthermore, the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' had been significantly weakened in the course of their defensive efforts so that by mid 1944, the Allies experienced day-time air dominance for the balance of the war, which would be critical to the Allied success in the [[Operation Overlord|Normandy Campaign]] and subsequent operations to the end of the war.<br />\n<br />\n=== US bombing in Europe ===<br />\n[[File:Ussb-1.svg|thumb|400px|right|Summary of AAF and RAF bombing &lt;ref&gt;US Strategic Bombing Survey: Statistical Appendix to Overall report (European War) (Feb 1947) table 1&lt;/ref&gt;.]]<br />\nIn mid 1942, the [[United States Army Air Forces]] arrived in the UK and carried out a few raids across the English Channel against Germany. In January 1943, at the [[Casablanca Conference]], it was agreed that RAF Bomber Command operations against Germany would be reinforced by the USAAF in a Combined Operations Offensive plan called [[Operation Pointblank]]. Chief of the British Air Staff [[Marshal of the Royal Air Force|MRAF]] [[Charles Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford|Sir Charles Portal]] was put in charge of the &quot;strategic direction&quot; of both British and American bomber operations. The text of the [[Casablanca directive]] read: &quot;Your primary object will be the progressive destruction and dislocation of the German military, industrial and economic system and the undermining of the morale of the German people to a point where their capacity for armed resistance is fatally weakened.&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Arthur Travers, ed Cox, Sebastian (1995).

USAAF leaders firmly held to the claim of &quot;precision&quot; bombing of military targets for much of the war, and energetically refuted claims that they were simply bombing cities. In reality, the day bombing was &quot;precision bombing&quot; only in the sense that most bombs fell somewhere near a specific designated target such as a railway yard. Conventionally, the air forces designated as &quot;the target area&quot; a circle having a radius of 1000 feet around the aiming point of attack. While accuracy improved during the war, Survey studies show that, in the over-all, only about 20% of the bombs aimed at precision targets fell within this target area. .&lt;ref&gt; United States Strategic Bombing Survey &lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 1944, only seven per cent of all bombs dropped by the Eighth Air Force hit within 1,000 feet of their aim point.<br />\n<br />\nNevertheless, the sheer tonnage of explosive delivered by day and by night was eventually sufficient to cause widespread damage, and, more importantly from a military point of view, forced Germany to divert resources to counter it. This was to be the real significance of the Allied strategic bombing campaign—resource allocation. <br />\n<br />\nU.S. operations began with 'Pointblank' attacks, designed to eliminate key features of the German economy. These attacks manifested themselves in the infamous Schweinfurt raids. Formations of unescorted bombers were no match for German fighters, which inflicted a deadly toll. In despair, the Eighth halted air operations over Germany until a long-range fighter could be found; it proved to be the [[P-51 Mustang]], which had the range to fly to Berlin and back. <br />\n<br />\n[[File:8th AF Bombing Marienburg.JPEG|thumb|left|A raid by the [[8th Air Force]] on the [[Focke Wulf]] factory at [[Marienburg]], [[Germany]] (1943).]]<br />\n<br />\nWith the arrival of the brand-new [[Fifteenth Air Force]], based in Italy, command of the U.S. Air Forces in Europe was consolidated into the [[United States Strategic Air Forces]] (USSTAF). With the addition of the Mustang to its strength, the [[Combined Bomber Offensive]] was resumed. Planners targeted the ''Luftwaffe'' in an operation known as '[[Big Week]]' (20 - 25 February 1944) and succeeded brilliantly - losses were so heavy German planners were forced into a hasty dispersal of industry and the day fighter arm never fully recovered.<br />\n<br />\nOn 27 March, 1944, the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] issued orders granting control of all the Allied air forces in Europe, including strategic bombers, to General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the Supreme Allied Commander, who delegated command to his deputy in [[SHAEF]] Air Chief Marshal [[Arthur Tedder, 1st Baron Tedder|Arthur Tedder]]. There was resistance to this order from some senior figures, including [[Winston Churchill]], Harris, and [[Carl Spaatz]], but after some debate, control passed to SHAEF on 1 April 1944. When the Combined Bomber Offensive officially ended on 1 April, Allied airmen were well on the way to achieving air superiority over all of Europe. While they continued some strategic bombing, the USAAF along with the RAF turned their attention to the tactical air battle in support of the [[Normandy Invasion]]. It was not until the middle of September that the strategic bombing campaign of Germany again became the priority for the [[USSTAF]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NL309-312&quot;&gt;Norman Longmate, ''The Bombers:The RAF Offensive against Germany 1939-1945'', pp.309-312&lt;/ref&gt; <br />\n<br />\nThe twin campaigns—the USAAF by day, the RAF by night—built up into massive bombing of German industrial areas, notably [[Ruhr area|the Ruhr]], followed by attacks directly on cities such as [[Bombing of Hamburg in World War II|Hamburg]], [[bombing of Kassel in World War II|Kassel]], [[Bombing of Pforzheim in World War II|Pforzheim]], [[Mainz]] and the often-criticized [[bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]].<br />\n<br />\n=== Effectiveness===<br />\nStrategic bombing has been criticized on practical grounds because it does not always work predictably. The radical changes it forces on a targeted population can backfire, including the counterproductive result of freeing inessential labourers to fill worker shortages in war industries.&lt;ref&gt;J.K Galbraith, &quot;The Affluent Society&quot;, chapter 12 &quot;The Illusion of National Security&quot;. Book first published 1958. Galbraith was a director of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey.&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-668-7167-21, Reichsgebiet, Leitstand der 4. Flakdivision.jpg|thumb|right|German soldier plots coordinates on a map in the Duisburg-Wolfsburg anti-aircraft division]]<br />\nMuch of the doubt about the effectiveness of the bomber war comes from the oft-stated fact that German industrial production increased throughout the war. While this is true, it fails to note production also increased in the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, [[Canada]] and [[Australia]]. And, in all of those countries, the rate of production increased much more rapidly than in Germany. Until late in the war, industry had not been geared for war and German factory workers only worked a single shift. Simply by going to three shifts, production could have been tripled with no change to the infrastructure. However, attacks on the infrastructure were taking place. The attacks on Germany's canals and railroads made transportation of [[materiel]] difficult.<br />\n<br />\nThe attack on oil production, [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] and tank farms was, however, extremely successful and made a very large contribution to the general collapse of Germany in 1945. In the event, the bombing of oil facilities became [[Albert Speer]]'s main concern; however, this occurred sufficiently late in the war that Germany would soon be defeated in any case. Nevertheless, it is fair to say the oil bombing campaign materially shortened the war, thereby saving many lives.<br />\n<br />\nGerman insiders credit the Allied bombing offensive with severely handicapping them. Speer repeatedly said (both during and after the war) it caused crucial production problems. Admiral [[Karl Dönitz]], head of the [[U-Boat]] arm, noted in his memoirs that failure to get the revolutionary [[German Type XXI submarine|Type XXI]] [[U-boat]]s (which could have completely altered the balance of power in the [[Battle of the Atlantic (1939–1945)|Battle of the Atlantic]]) into service was entirely the result of the bombing. The [[Strategic Bombing Survey (Europe)|United States Strategic Bombing Survey (Europe)]], however, concluded the delays in deploying the new submarines cannot be attributed to air attack.<br />\n<br />\n=== Effect on morale===<br />\n[[File:Die Festung Europa hat kein Dach.JPG|thumb|right|Propaganda leaflet dropped by the [[RAF]] after a bombing raid on [[Essen]].]]<br />\n<br />\nAlthough designed to &quot;break the enemy's will&quot;, the opposite often happened. The British did not crumble under the German [[The Blitz|Blitz]] and other [[strategic bombing|air raid]]s early in the war. British workers continued to work throughout the war and food and other basic supplies were available throughout.<br />\n<br />\nIn Germany, apparently morale did not effectively break down in the face of the bombing campaign, which was far more extensive and comprehensive in effect, scope and duration than that endured by the United Kingdom. <br />\n<br />\n=== Allied bombing statistics 1939–45 ===<br />\n{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;<br />\n| valign=&quot;top&quot; |<br />\n<br />\n{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;<br />\n|+ RAF Bombing Sorties &amp; Losses 1939–45 &lt;ref name = &quot;Humble&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Humble |first=Richard |title=War In The Air 1939–1945 |year=1975 |location=London |publisher=Salamander |oclc=4248555}}&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n!<br />\n!Sorties<br />\n!Losses<br />\n|-<br />\n!

In the last seven months of the campaign, a change to firebombing tactics resulted in great destruction of 67 Japanese cities, as many as 500,000 Japanese deaths and some 5 million more made homeless. [[Emperor Hirohito]]'s viewing of the destroyed areas of Tokyo in March 1945, is said to have been the beginning of his personal involvement in the peace process, culminating in [[Surrender of Japan|Japan's surrender]] five months later.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, F. J. ''No Strategic Targets Left''. &quot;Contribution of Major Fire Raids Toward Ending WWII&quot;, Turner Publishing Company, limited edition. ISBN 1-56311-483-6. p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\n==== Conventional bombing ====<br />\n{{Refimprove|section|date=August 2009}}<br />\n[[File:Firebombing of Tokyo.jpg|thumb|left|Tokyo burns during a [[Firebombing|firebomb]] attack 26 May 1945.]]<br />\n<br />\nThe first U.S. raid on the Japanese main island was the [[Doolittle Raid]] of 18 April, 1942 when sixteen [[B-25 Mitchell]]s were launched from the [[USS Hornet (CV-8)|USS ''Hornet'']] (CV-8) to attack targets including [[Yokohama]] and [[Tokyo]] and then fly on to airfields in [[China]]. The raids were military pin-pricks, but a significant [[propaganda]] victory. Launched prematurely, none of the attacking aircraft reached the designated post mission airfields, either crashing or ditching (except for one aircraft, which landed in the [[Soviet Union]], where the crew was interned). Two crews were captured by the Japanese.<br />\n<br />\nThe key development for the bombing of Japan was the [[B-29 Superfortress]], which had an operational range of 1,500 miles (2,400&amp;nbsp;km); almost 90% of the bombs dropped on the home islands of Japan were delivered by this type of bomber (147,000 tons). The first raid by B-29s on Japan from China was on 15 June, 1944. The planes took off from [[Chengdu]], over 1,500 miles away. This first raid was also not particularly damaging to Japan. Only forty-seven of the sixty-eight B–29s that took off hit the target area; four aborted with mechanical problems, four crashed, six jettisoned their bombs because of mechanical difficulties, and others bombed secondary targets or targets of opportunity. Only one B–29 was lost to enemy aircraft. The first raid from the east was on 24 November, 1944 when 88 aircraft bombed Tokyo. The bombs were dropped from around 30,000 feet (10,000 m) and it is estimated that only around 10% of the bombs hit designated targets.<br />\n<br />\nThe initial raids were carried out by the [[Twentieth Air Force]] operating out of mainland China in [[Operation Matterhorn]] under [[XX Bomber Command]]. Initially the Twentieth Air Force was under the command of [[Hap Arnold]], and later [[Curtis LeMay]]. This was never a satisfactory arrangement because not only were the Chinese airbases difficult to supply via - materiel being sent over &quot;[[the Hump]]&quot; from [[India]], but the B-29s operating from them could only reach Japan if they traded some of their bomb load for extra fuel in tanks in the bomb-bays. When Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]]'s [[island-hopping]] campaign captured islands close enough to Japan to be within the range of B-29s, the Twentieth Air Force was assigned to [[XXI Bomber Command]] which organized a much more effective bombing campaign of the Japanese home islands. Based in the [[Marianas]] ([[Guam]] and [[Tinian]] in particular) the B-29s were now able to carry their full bomb loads and were supplied by cargo ships and tankers.<br />\n<br />\n[[File:JapaneseCityDestroyedAreas.png|left|thumb|Conventional bombs from [[B-29 Superfortress|B-29s]] destroyed over 40% of the urban area in Japan's six greatest industrial cities.]]<br />\nUnlike all other forces in theater, the [[Bomber Command]]s did not report to the commanders of the theaters but directly to the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]. In March 1945, they were placed under the U.S. Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific which was commanded by General [[Carl Spaatz]].<br />\n<br />\nAs in Europe, the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) tried daylight [[precision bombing]]. However, it proved to be impossible due to the weather around Japan, as bombs dropped from a great height were tossed about by high winds. General LeMay, commander of XXI Bomber Command, instead switched to mass firebombing night attacks from altitudes of around 7,000 feet (2,100 m) on the major [[conurbation]]s of [[Tokyo]], [[Nagoya]], [[Osaka]], and [[Kobe]]. Despite limited early success, particularly against Nagoya, LeMay was determined to use such bombing tactics against the vulnerable Japanese cities. Attacks on strategic targets also continued in lower-level daylight raids.<br />\n<br />\nThe first successful [[firebombing]] raid was [[Bombing of Kobe in World War II|on Kobe]] on 3 February 1945, and following its relative success the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] continued the tactic. Nearly half of the principal factories of the city were damaged, and production was reduced by more than half at one of the port's two shipyards.<br />\n<br />\nMuch of the armor and defensive weaponry of the bombers was removed to allow increased bomb loads; Japanese [[air defense]] in terms of night-fighters and [[anti-aircraft gun]]s was so feeble it was hardly a risk. [[Bombing of Tokyo in World War II|The first raid of this type on Tokyo]] was on the night of 23&amp;ndash;24 February when 174 B-29s destroyed around one square mile (3&amp;nbsp;km²) of the city. Following on that success 334 B-29s raided on the night of 9&amp;ndash;10 March, dropping around 1,700 tons of bombs. Around 16 square miles (41&amp;nbsp;km²) of the city was destroyed and over 100,000 people are estimated to have died in the [[fire storm]]. The destruction and damage was at its worst in the city sections east of the Imperial Palace. It was the most destructive conventional raid in all of history. The city was made primarily of wood and paper, and Japanese firefighting methods were not up to the challenge. The fires burned out of control, boiling canal water and causing entire blocks of buildings to spontaneously combust from the heat. The effects of the Tokyo firebombing proved the fears expressed by Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto|Yamamoto]] in 1939: &quot;Japanese cities, being made of wood and paper, would burn very easily. The Army talks big, but if war came and there were large-scale air raids, there's no telling what would happen.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spector&quot;&gt;Spector, Ronald (1985). &quot;Eagle Against the Sun.&quot; New York: Vintage Books. p. 503.&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\nIn the following two weeks, there were almost 1,600 further [[sortie]]s against the four cities, destroying 31 square miles (80&amp;nbsp;km²) in total at a cost of 22 aircraft. By June, over forty percent of the urban area of Japan's largest six cities (Tokyo, Nagoya, Kobe, Osaka, [[Yokohama]], and [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]]) was devastated. LeMay's fleet of nearly 600 bombers destroyed tens of smaller cities and manufacturing centers in the following weeks and months.<br />\n<br />\nLeaflets were dropped over cities before they were bombed, warning the people and urging them to escape the city. Though many, even within the Air Force, viewed this as a form of [[psychological warfare]], a significant element in the decision to produce and drop them was the desire to assuage American anxieties about the extent of the destruction created by this new war tactic.  Warning leaflets were also dropped on cities that were not to be bombed to create uncertainty and absenteeism.<br />\n<br />\nA year after the war, the [[United States Army Air Forces]]'s [[Strategic Bombing Survey (Pacific War)]] reported that they had underestimated the power of strategic bombing combined with naval blockade and previous military defeats to bring Japan to unconditional surrender without invasion. By July 1945, only a fraction of the planned strategic bombing force had been deployed yet there were few targets left worth the effort. In hindsight, it would have been more effective to use land-based and carrier-based air power to strike against merchant shipping and begin aerial mining at a much earlier date so as to link up with the effective [[Pacific War#Submarine warfare|Allied submarine anti-shipping campaign]] and completely isolate the island nation. This would have accelerated the strangulation of Japan and ended the war sooner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anesi.com/ussbs01.htm United States Strategic Bombing Survey, Summary Report (Pacific War). 1 July 1946]&lt;/ref&gt; A postwar [[Naval Ordnance Laboratory]] survey agreed, finding that naval mines dropped by B-29s had accounted for 60% of all Japanese shipping losses in the last six months of the war.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Hallion, Dr. Richard P.

The [[bombing of Tokyo in World War II]] cut the city's industrial productivity in half.]]<br />\n<br />\n'''Strategic bombing''' is a [[military strategy]] used in a [[total war]] with the goal of defeating an enemy nation-state by destroying its economic ability to wage war rather than destroying its land or naval forces. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize [[strategic bomber]]s, long- or medium-range [[missile]]s, or nuclear-armed [[fighter-bomber]] aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to an enemy's war-making capacity. <br />\n<br />\nOne of the legitimate aims of war is to demoralise the enemy, so that the enemy no longer have the will to continue to oppose friendly forces, and strategic bombing can be used to this end. Since the phrase &quot;[[#Terror bombing|terror bombing]]&quot; entered the English lexicon towards the end of World War II, many strategic bombing campaigns and individual raids have been described as such by some commentators and historians, but because the term has prerogative connotations others have denied that such bombing campaigns and raids are examples of &quot;terror bombing&quot;. <br />\n<br />\n==Strategic bombing==<br />\nWhile the distinction between [[military tactics|tactical]], [[military operations|operational]], and [[strategy|strategic]] bombing can be blurred, they are distinct methodologies generally used for different purposes. Strategic bombing is a methodology distinct from both tactical bombing and the use of strategic air assets in an operational capacity. <br />\n<br />\nSuch a strategy usually involves sustained attacks over a period of time on targets that affect a nation's overall war making capability, such as [[factory|factories]], [[rail transport|railroads]], [[oil refinery|oil industries]], and other resources. Less frequently, individual strategic attacks are made against 'point' targets, such as Britain's [[Bomber Command]] attacks against [[Operation Chastise|the Ruhr dams]] by means of the [[bouncing bomb|bouncing bomb development]] in May, 1943.<br />\n<br />\nAs strategic bombing aims to undermine an enemy nation-state's ability to wage war, strategic bombers need to be able to reach targets throughout most or all of that nation, and so have tended to be larger, longer-ranged aircraft. Strategic bombers have also been used to support major military ground operations, such as the isolation of Normandy through the bombing of transportation hubs throughout northern France in support of the [[D-Day]] invasion, or the carpet bombing of the Axis front lines west of St. Lo in support of [[Operation Cobra]].<br />\n<br />\nAn aerial attack strategy of deliberately bombing and/or strafing civilian targets in order to break the morale of an enemy, make its civilian population panic, bend the enemy's political leadership to the attacker's will, or to &quot;punish&quot; an enemy, while strategic in nature, is more correctly termed [[terror bombing]].<br />\n<br />\n==Methods used to deliver ordnance==<br />\nThere are three basic methods used to deliver ordnance onto targets in a strategic bombing campaign. The first is by gravity-dropping large numbers of [[gravity bomb|iron bombs]] or &quot;dumb bombs&quot;, using strategic bombers. The second is through the use of more precise ordnance, [[precision-guided munition]]s (so-called smart bombs); [[cruise missile]]s fall into this category, though they are not always air-launched. The third method involves the use of nuclear ordnance, either onto a battlefield in a method similar to carpet bombing, or onto a strategic target, as with iron bombs in WW II. <br />\n<br />\nAlthough the deployment of [[nuclear weapons]] from aircraft falls into the category of strategic bombing, and likely represents the ultimate form of both strategic and terror bombing, the term strategic bombing is generally used in reference to the release of non-nuclear air-ground ordnance from strategic aircraft.<br />\n<br />\nArea attack by multiple bombers is based upon detailed calculations of the intended Damage Expectancy or &quot;DE&quot; directed by the Air Tasking Order (ATO) used in a military strategy. To achieve a particular DE, planners select a bomb type based on that particular weapon's damage mechanism - blast/fragmentation or incendiary, for example. Planners then calculate the Single Sortie Probability of Damage (SSPD) and extrapolate from there, adding sorties until the probability of damage meets or exceeds the required DE. <br />\n<br />\nAs weapons have grown more precise, the need for mass formations dropping masses of bombs has decreased, and it is now possible for a single bomb to accomplish what in the past took many bombers. In fact, one [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] can now drop a single bomb from many miles away that can be programmed to strike a target as small as a window or doorway from a chosen direction and at a preselected angle. This can focus the blast in a given direction and can dramatically reduce the risk of collateral damage to other buildings and consequent unintended civilian casualties.  <br />\n<br />\nStrategic bombing by multiple modern strategic bombers like the B-52 can be likened to an hour during [[Battle of the Somme|the Somme]] bottled into a thirty-second time period. However, some believe this delivery method has been rather ineffective in attacking a nation's warmaking capability, due to the imprecise nature of the attack. Others cite the destruction of enemy infrastructure, resources expended on civil defense and physical protection of sites, and the reallocation of military resources away from the battlefield in order to staff response and air and ground antiaircraft assets as proof of its efficacy. In either case, the unintended [[Collateral damage|mass civilian casualties]], terror caused, and ethical questions raised draws adverse long-term attention to the morality of strategic bombing.<br />\n<br />\n[[Carpet bombing]], often confused with strategic bombing, is the use of strategic air assets for operational objectives in support of ground forces. Its use during Operation Cobra is the best-known example. Carpet bombing is viewed ambivalently by ground forces, due to the nigh-inevitable friendly casualties caused by bombers dropping their ordnance short of the aiming point, either through error or &quot;bomb creep&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter J. Boyne|Boyne, Walter J.]], ''Clash of Wings: World War II in the Air'', Simon &amp; Schuster, NY, 1994, pp.343-44.&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\nThe use of &quot;smart&quot; weapons is preferred by some nations for two reasons. First, it can be less devastating. Due to the greater accuracy (the smaller [[Circular Error Probable|CEP]]) of precision guided weapons, there is less risk of civilian casualties. The second reason is the more-focused damage associated with precision weapons. Strategic bombing can destroy an entire block, but miss the vital components of a factory. Precision weapons can attack precise components of designated targets, increasing the likelihood of a successful attack. However, the 'shock' value of precision bombing is less severe than of area bombing. Unless multiple precision weapons are used, an enemy may seek cover or disperse to different parts of the targeted area. Additionally, [[area bombing]] can have an initial significant psychological effect, as the bombing of cities early in World War II terrified their citizens.<br />\n<br />\n==Enemy morale and terror bombing==<br />\n{{section|Terror bombing}}<br />\nOne of the legitimate aims of war is to demoralise the enemy, so that the enemy no longer have the will to continue to oppose friendly forces, and although strategic bombing can be used to attack fixed strategic assets, such as transportation nodes, that directly contribute to physically weakening an enemy, attacks can also be used to demoralise an enemy either as a primary of secondary objective.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Terror bombing&quot; is an emotive term used to describe aerial attacks made by a belligerent intended to demoralise an enemy.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;For terrorist attacks that involve bombings see the articles [[terrorism]] and [[List of terrorist incidents]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nehemia Geva &amp; Cigdem Sirin (Department of Political Science Texas A&amp;M University), and Keren Sharvit (Psychology Department Tel Aviv University).

However, at a [[SHAEF]] press conference on 16 February 1945, two days after the [[Bombing of Dresden]], British Air Commodore [[Colin McKay Grierson]],  replied to a question by one of the journalists that the primary target of the bombing had been on communications to prevent the Germans moving military supplies, and to stop movement in all directions if possible. He then added in an offhand remark that the raid also helped destroying &quot;what is left of German morale.&quot; Howard Cowan, an [[Associated Press]] war correspondent, subsequently filed a story about the Dresden raid. The military press censor at SHAEF made a mistake and allowed the Cowan cable to go out starting with &quot;Allied air bosses have have made the long awaited decision to adopt deliberate terror bombing of great German population centres&lt;!--sic in the source--&gt; as a ruthless expedient to hasten Hitler's doom.&quot; There were follow-up newspaper editorials on the issue and a long time opponent of strategic bombing, [[Richard Stokes]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]], asked questions in the House of Commons on 6 March.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2005) pp. 413,414&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\nThe controversy stirred up by the Cowan news report, reached the highest levels of the British Government when on 28 March 1945 the Prime Minister, [[Winston Churchill]], sent a memo by telegram to [[Hastings Lionel Ismay|General Ismay]] for the British Chiefs of Staff and the Chief of the Air Staff, in which he started with the sentence &quot;It seems to me that the moment has come when the question of bombing of German cities simply for the sake of increasing the terror, though under other pretexts, should be reviewed. ...&quot;&lt;ref name=Siebert&gt;Siebert, Detlef.

The first strategic bombing mission of the war was likely the dropping of five bombs on the [[Gare L'Est]] train station in Paris on August 30, 1914. Within a year or so, specialized aircraft and dedicated [[bomber]] squadrons were in service on both sides. These were generally used for tactical bombing: the aim was that of directly harming enemy troops, strongpoints, or equipment, usually within a relatively small distance of the front line. Eventually, attention turned to the possibility of causing ''indirect'' harm to the enemy by systematically attacking vital rear-area resources.<br />\n<br />\nThe first-ever dirigible aerial bombardment of civilians was on January 19, 1915, in which two German [[Zeppelin]]s dropped 24 fifty-kilogram (110 pound) high-explosive bombs and ineffective three-kilogram incendiaries on the Eastern England towns of [[Great Yarmouth]], [[Sheringham]], [[King's Lynn]], and the surrounding villages. In all, four people were killed, sixteen injured, and monetary damage was estimated at £7,740 (about US$36,000 at the time). German dirigibles also bombed [[Liepaja]] in Latvia on the Eastern Front in January, 1915.<br />\n<br />\nThere were a further nineteen raids in 1915, in which 37 tons of bombs were dropped, killing 181 people and injuring 455. Raids continued in 1916. London was accidentally bombed in May, and, in July, the Kaiser allowed directed raids against urban centers. There were 23 airship raids in 1916, in which 125 tons of ordnance were dropped, killing 293 people and injuring 691. Gradually British air defenses improved. In 1917 and 1918, there were only 11 Zeppelin raids against England, and the final raid occurred on August 5, 1918, which resulted in the death of KK [[Peter Strasser]], commander of the German Naval Airship Department. <br />\n<br />\nBy the end of the war, 51 raids had been undertaken, in which 5,806 bombs were dropped, killing 557 people and injuring 1,358. The Zeppelin raids were complemented by the [[Gotha G|Gotha]] bomber, which was the first heavier-than-air bomber to be used for strategic bombing. It has been argued that the raids were effective far beyond the material damage caused, in diverting and hampering wartime production, and diverting twelve squadrons and over 10,000 men to air defenses.<br />\n<br />\nThe French army on June 15, 1915 attacked the German town of [[Karlsruhe]], killing 29 civilians and wounding 58. Further raids followed until the Armistice in 1918. In a raid in the afternoon of June 22, 1916 the pilots used outdated maps and bombed the location of the abandoned railway station, where a [[circus]] tent was placed, killing 120 persons, most of them children.<br />\n<br />\nIn contrast, the British launched their own form of strategic bombing. At the start of the war, there were attacks by bombers of the [[Royal Navy Air Service]] (RNAS) against the Zeppelin production lines and their sheds at Cologne and Dusseldorf on September 22 and October 8, 1914. In late 1915, the order was given for attacks on German industrial targets and the 41st Wing was formed from units of the RNAS and [[Royal Flying Corps]]. The RNAS took to strategic bombing in bigger way than the RFC who were focussed on supporting the infantry actions of the Western Front. At first the RNAS attacked the German submarines in their moorings then steelworks further in targeting the origin of the submarines themselves.<br />\n<br />\nIn early 1918 they operated their &quot;round the clock&quot; bombing raid; with lighter bombs attacking the town of [[Trier]] by day and large [[Handley-Page O/400|HP O/400]]s attacking by night. In April 1918, the [[Independent Force, RAF|Independent Force]] was created, an expanded bombing group that by the end of the war had aircraft that could reach Berlin but were never used.<br />\n<br />\nFollowing the war, the concept of strategic bombing developed. The calculations which were performed on the number of dead to the weight of bombs dropped would have a profound effect on the attitudes of the British authorities and population in the interwar years, because as bombers became larger it was fully expected that deaths from aerial bombardment would approach those anticipated in the [[Cold War]] from the use of nuclear weapons. The fear of aerial attack on such a scale was one of the fundamental driving forces of British [[appeasement]] in the 1930s.<br />\n<br />\n===Period between the world wars===<br />\nIn the period between the two world wars, military thinkers from several nations advocated strategic bombing as the logical and obvious way to employ aircraft. Domestic political considerations saw to it that the British worked harder on the concept than most. The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Flying Corps]] and [[Royal Naval Air Service]] of the Great War had been merged in 1918 to create a separate air force, which spent much of the following two decades fighting for survival in an environment of severe government spending constraints. <br />\n<br />\n[[Royal Air Force]] leaders, in particular Air Chief Marshal [[Hugh Trenchard]], believed the key to retaining their independence from the senior services was to lay stress on what they saw as the unique ability of a modern air force to win wars by unaided strategic bombing. As the speed and altitude of bombers increased in proportion to fighter aircraft, the prevailing strategic understanding became &quot;[[the bomber will always get through]].&quot; Although anti-aircraft guns and fighter aircraft had proved effective in the Great War, it was accepted there was little warring nations could do to prevent massive civilian casualties from strategic bombing. High civilian morale and retaliation in kind were seen as the only answers. (A later generation would revisit this, as [[Mutual Assured Destruction]].)<br />\n<br />\nIn Europe, the air power prophet General [[Giulio Douhet]] asserted the basic principle of strategic bombing was the offensive, and there was no defence against [[carpet bombing]] and [[poison gas]] attacks. Douhet's apocalyptic predictions found fertile soil in France, Germany, and the United States, where excerpts from his book ''The Command of the Air'' (1921) were published. These visions of cities laid waste by bombing also gripped the popular imagination and found expression in [[novel]]s such as Douhet's ''The War of 19--'' (1930) and [[H.G. Wells]]'s ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'' (1933) (filmed by [[Alexander Korda]] as ''[[Things to Come]]'' (1936)).<br />\n<br />\nDouhet's proposals were hugely influential amongst airforce enthusiasts, arguing as they did that the bombing air arm was the most important, powerful and invulnerable part of any military. He envisaged future wars as lasting a matter of a few weeks. While each opposing Army and Navy fought an inglorious holding campaign, the respective Air Forces would dismantle their enemies' country, and if one side did not rapidly surrender, both would be so weak after the first few days that the war would effectively cease. Fighter aircraft would be relegated to spotting patrols, but would be essentially powerless to resist the mighty bombers. <br />\n<br />\nIn support of this theory he argued for targeting of the civilian population as much as any military target, since a nation's morale was as important a resource as its weapons. Paradoxically, he suggested that this would actually reduce total casualties, since &quot;The time would soon come when, to put an end to horror and suffering, the people themselves, driven by the instinct of self-preservation, would rise up and demand an end to the war...&quot;. As a result of Douhet's proposals airforces allocated greater resources to their bomber squadrons than to their fighters, and the 'dashing young pilots' promoted in propaganda of the time were invariably bomber pilots. <br />\n<br />\nPre-war planners, on the whole, vastly overestimated the damage bombers could do, and underestimated the resilience of civilian populations. The speed and altitude of modern bombers, and the difficulty of hitting a target while under attack from improved ground fire and fighters which had yet to be built was not appreciated. Jingoistic national pride played a major role: for example, at a time when Germany was still disarmed and France was Britain's only European rival, Trenchard boasted, &quot;the French in a bombing duel would probably squeal before we did&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, ''History of Air Fighting''.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the expectation was any new war would be brief and very savage. A British Cabinet planning document in 1938 predicted that, if war with Germany broke out, 35% of British homes would be hit by bombs in the first three weeks. (This type of expectation should be kept in mind when considering the conduct of the European leaders who [[appeasement|appeased]] [[Hitler]] in the late 1930s.)&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, ''History of Air Fighting''.&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\nDouhet's theories were tested at [[bombing of Guernica|Guernica]] and [[Guangzhou]], which produced international outrage, but not the surrender of the nation that was bombed. They were more successful in [[Mesopotamia]] (modern-day [[Iraq]]) where RAF bombers used conventional bombs, gas bombs, and strafed civilian populations identified as engaging in guerrilla uprisings. [[Arthur Travers Harris|Arthur Harris]], a young RAF squadron commander (later nicknamed [[List of military figures by nickname#B|&quot;Bomber&quot;)]], reported after a mission in 1924, &quot;The Arab and Kurd now know what real bombing means, in casualties and damage. They know that within 45 minutes a full-sized village can be practically wiped out and a third of its inhabitants killed or injured.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Omissi, David. ''Air Power and Colonial Control: The Royal Air Force 1919-1939''. Manchester University Press, 1990. ISBN 0719029600&lt;/ref&gt; Bombing as a military strategy proved to be an effective and efficient way for the British to police their [[Middle East]] protectorates in the 1920s. Fewer men were required as compared to ground forces.&lt;ref&gt;Omissi, David. ''Air Power and Colonial Control: The Royal Air Force 1919-1939''. Manchester University Press, 1990. ISBN 0719029600&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\n===World War II===<br />\n{{main|Strategic bombing during World War II}}<br />\n[[Image:WWII Schweinfurt Raid.jpg|thumb|right|1943 [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] raid on [[ball bearing]] works at [[Schweinfurt]], Germany]]<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1970-050-31, Berlin, Opfer eines Luftangriffes.jpg|thumb|right|Victims of a September 1944 raid on [[Berlin]].]]<br />\n<br />\nThe strategic bombing conducted in World War II was unlike anything the world had seen before. The campaigns conducted in Europe, in [[Bombing of Chongqing| China]] and at the end of the war over Japan, could involve thousands of aircraft dropping tens of thousands of tons of [[munitions]] over a single city.<br />\n<br />\nStrategic-bombing campaigns were conducted in Europe and Asia. The Germans and Japanese made use of mostly twin-engined bombers with a payload generally less than 5000 pounds, and never produced larger craft to any great extent. By comparison, the British and Americans (who started the war with predominantly similarly-sized bombers) developed their strategic force based upon much larger four-engined bombers for their strategic campaigns. The payload carried by these planes ranged from 2.7 tons for the [[B-17 Flying Fortress]], to 8 tons for the [[Avro Lancaster]] and 9 tons for the [[B-29 Superfortress]], with some specialty aircraft, such as the 'Special B' Avro Lancaster carrying an 11-ton (9,979 kg) [[Grand Slam bomb]].<br />\n<br />\nDuring the first year of the war in Europe, strategic bombing was developed through trial and error. The ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' had been attacking both civilian and military targets from the very first day of the war, when Germany [[invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] on 1 September 1939. A strategic-bombing campaign was launched to break British morale and achieve a peace agreement after the ''Luftwaffe'' proved unable to defeat the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in the air, and the proposed invasion of Great Britain had to be indefinitely postponed. <br />\n<br />\nInitially, the raids took place in daylight, then changed to night bombing attacks when losses became unsustainable. The RAF, initially espousing a precision-bombing doctrine, also switched to night bombing due to excessive losses. After the [[Butt Report]] (released in September, 1941) proved the inadequacy of [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]] training and equipment to carry it out, the RAF adopted an area-attack strategy, attempting to break German civilian morale. <br />\n<br />\nThe [[United States Army Air Forces]] adopted a policy of daylight precision bombing for greater accuracy as, for example, during the [[Schweinfurt]] raids. That doctrine, which included the fallacious theory that bombers could adequately defend themselves against air attack with their own armament, entailed much higher American losses until long-range fighter escorts became available.<br />\n<br />\nStrategic bombing was initially a way of taking the war into Europe while Allied ground forces were no closer to fighting Germans there than North Africa. Between them, the Allied air forces claimed to be able to bomb around the clock. In fact, few targets were ever hit by British and American forces the same day, the strategic isolation of Normandy on [[D-Day]] and the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|the bombing of Dresden]] in February, 1945 being exceptions rather than the rule. There were generally no coordinated plans for &quot;around the clock&quot; bombing of any target.<br />\n<br />\nEven single missions have been considered to constitute strategic bombing. The British bombing of [[Peenemünde]] was such an event, as was the bombing of the Ruhr dams. The Peenemünde mission delayed Nazi Germany's [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] program enough it did not become a factor in the outcome of the war.<br />\n<br />\nStrategic bombing in Europe never reached the decisive completeness the American campaign against Japan achieved, helped in part by the fragility of [[Housing in Japan|Japanese housing]], which was particularly vulnerable to [[firebombing]] through the use of [[incendiary bomb]]s. The destruction of German [[infrastructure]] became apparent, but the Allied campaign against Germany only really succeeded when the Allies began targeting oil refineries and transportation in the last year of the war. At the same time, strategic bombing of Germany was used as a morale booster for the Allies in the period before the land war resumed in Western Europe.<br />\n<br />\nIf the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] and the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Service]] frequently used strategic bombing over large Chinese cities such as [[battle of Shanghai|Shanghai]], [[Guangzhou]], [[Nanjing]], and [[bombing of Chongqing|Chongqing]], in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre]], organized strategic bombing on a large scale by the Japanese seldom occurred. The Japanese military in most places advanced quickly enough that a strategic bombing campaign was unnecessary. In those places where it was required, the smaller Japanese bombers (in comparison to British and American types) did not carry a bombload sufficient to inflict the sort of damage regularly occurring at that point in the war in Europe, or later in Japan.<br />\n<br />\nThe development of the B-29 gave the United States a bomber with sufficient range to reach the Japanese Home Islands from the safety of American bases in the Pacific or Western China. The capture of the Japanese island of [[Iwo Jima]] further enhanced the capabilities that the Americans possessed in their strategic bombing campaign. Conventional bombs and [[incendiary bomb]]s were used against Japan to devastating effect.<br />\n<br />\n===Cold War===<br />\n[[Nuclear weapon]]s defined strategic bombing during the [[Cold War]]. The age of the massive strategic bombing campaign had come to an end. It was replaced by more devastating attacks using improved sighting and weapons technology. Strategic bombing by the [[Great Powers]] also became politically indefensible. The political fallout resulting from the destruction being broadcast on the [[evening news]] ended more than one strategic bombing campaign.<br />\n<br />\nIn the Vietnam war, the strategic bombing of North Vietnam in [[Operation Rolling Thunder]] could have been more extensive, but fear by the [[Lyndon Johnson|Johnson Administration]] of the entry of China into the war (and misapprehension of the nature and technique of strategic bombing) led to restrictions on the selection of targets, as well as only a gradual escalation of intensity. <br />\n<br />\nThe aim of the bombing campaign was to demoralize the North Vietnamese, damage their economy, and reduce their capacity to support the war in the hope that they would negotiate for peace, but it failed to have those effects. The [[Richard Nixon|Nixon Administration]] continued this sort of limited strategic bombing during the two [[Operation Linebacker]] campaigns. Images such as that of [[Kim Phuc Phan Thi]] (although this incident was the result of [[close air support]] rather than strategic bombing) disturbed the American public enough to demand a stop to the campaign.<br />\n<br />\nDue to this, and the ineffectiveness of [[carpet bombing]] (partly because of a lack of identifiable targets), new precision weapons were developed. The new weapons allowed more effective and efficient bombing with reduced [[civilian]] casualties. High civilian casualties had always been the [[hallmark]] of strategic bombing, but later in the Cold War, this began to change.<br />\n<br />\nThe [[Israeli Air Force]] used strategic bombing during its brief but intense wars with its neighbors during the [[Six Day War|Six Day]] and [[Yom Kippur War|Yom Kippur]] wars. Strategic bombing was entering a new phase of high-intensity attacks, specifically targeting [[factory|factories]] taking years and millions of dollars to build.<br />\n<br />\n===Post-Cold War===<br />\nStrategic bombing in the post-Cold War era is defined by American advances in and the use of [[smart munitions]]. Beginning with the [[Gulf War|First Gulf War]], and then more frequently in the [[Kosovo War]] and the initial phases of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 Invasion of Iraq]], strategic bombing campaigns were notable for the heavy use of precision weaponry by those countries that possessed them. Although bombing campaigns were still strategic in their aims, the widespread area bombing tactics of World War II had mostly disappeared. This led to significantly fewer civilian casualties associated with previous bombing campaigns, though it has not brought about a complete end to civilian deaths or collateral property damage. <br />\n<br />\nAdditionally, strategic bombing via smart munitions is now possible through the use of aircraft that have been considered traditionally tactical in nature such as the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]] or [[F-15E Strike Eagle]], which had been used during [[Operation Desert Storm]], [[Operation Allied Force]], [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] and [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] to destroy targets that would have required large formations of strategic bombers during WWII. <br />\n<br />\nSome people refer to such pinpoint destruction of strategic, logistical or communications/command targets as &quot;strategic '''interdiction'''&quot; in order to distinguish from the large concentrated use of conventional or nuclear weapons against highly concentrated [[terror bombing|population centers]] or industrial targets, which is what &quot;strategic bombing&quot; had traditionally connoted during WWII and the Cold War. That said, such bombing still may have a place, as evidenced during the [[2008 South Ossetia war]] when Russian aircraft attacked the shipbuilding center of [[Poti]].&lt;ref&gt;Earl Tilford. [http://www.urbantulsa.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A24888 Russia's Georgia Take-Down: Implications for Russia and America]]&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\n==Technological advances==<br />\nWith the advent of [[precision-guided munition]]s, many feel that strategic bombing has once again become a viable military strategy. Exactly how precise precision munitions are is still open to question. However, others predict that 21st century warfare will more often be [[asymmetrical warfare|asymmetrical]], and therefore viable strategic bombing options may not exist.<br />\n<br />\nA further question is raised when some see the blurring of strategic and tactical targets and missions, particularly when tactical aircraft are frequently used to carry out strikes on targets with significant strategic importance as a result of technological advances in aircraft design and munition guidance and penetration. For example, tactical strike aircraft such as [[F-16s]] were frequently used to destroy command and communications bunkers during [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] while large &quot;strategic&quot; bombers such as the [[B-1 Lancer|B-1]] and [[B-52]] were frequently used to provide sustained close air support at high altitude during [[Operation Enduring Freedom]].<br />\n<br />\n==Strategic bombing events==<br />\nAmong the controversial instances of strategic bombing (and it should be noted that there is still significant controversy over whether all of these events even constitute strategic bombing, as opposed to other forms, such as terror bombing) are:<br />\n{{col-begin}}<br />\n{{col-2}}<br />\n* Strategic bombing of &quot;uncivilized tribes&quot; during the British [[League of Nations mandate|mandate]] of [[Iraq]]<br />\n* [[Spanish Civil War]]<br />\n** The [[Bombing of Guernica]]: the first aerial bombardment in history in which a civilian population was targeted with the apparent intent of producing civilian casualties.<br />\n* World War II<br />\n** The Japanese [[battle of Wuhan|bombing of Wuhan]]<br />\n** The Japanese [[bombing of Chongqing]]<br />\n** The Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]<br />\n** The German bombing of [[Warsaw]]<br />\n** The German [[Rotterdam Blitz|bombing of Rotterdam]]<br />\n** German attacks on the UK during [[The Blitz]] and afterwards, through the V-1 and V-2 attacks in the last year of the war.<br />\n** The German bombing of [[Belgrade]]<br />\n** The German bombing of Moscow.<br />\n** Allied [[Bombing of Hamburg in World War II|bombing of Hamburg]]<br />\n** Allied [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|bombing of Berlin]]<br />\n** Allied [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]]<br />\n** Allied bombing of [[Milan]].<br />\n** United States [[Doolittle Raid|bombing of Tokyo]]<br />\n** United States [[Bombing of Tokyo in World War II|bombing of Tokyo]]<br />\n** United States [[Bombing of Kobe in World War II|bombing of Kobe]]<br />\n** United States [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]<br />\n{{col-2}}<br />\n* [[Vietnam War]]<br />\n** United States bombing of the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]]<br />\n** United States bombing of [[Hanoi]]<br />\n** United States bombing of [[Cambodia]]<br />\n* [[Gulf War]] (1990-1991)<br />\n* [[Yugoslav Wars]] (1991-1999)<br />\n** [[NATO bombing of Republika Srpska]] (1995) (Operation Deliberate Force)<br />\n** [[Kosovo War]] (1999)<br />\n*** [[NATO]] bombing of industry and other civilian infrastructure in [[Serbia]].

Most wikipedia articles of nigerian prominent personalities are unsourced, written like an advert, do not follow wikipedia quality standards and do not have pictures in them. There are hardly any reliable verifiable third party sources available. This is why I have decided not to update most of the wiki articles of Nollywood actresses/actors. Those that I have updated had enough reliable sources that I could use as reference. For example, [[Pete Edochie]] is one of the most famous and successful nigerian nollywood actors. He has been acting since the 1970s, and is still very active in Nollywood. But there are no reliable sources available, not even his date of birth. This is why I will bypass his article until reliable sources are found. The article of [[Omotola Jalade Ekeinde]] is written like an advert, it has multiple issues, needs to be wikified, and has no sources. This again is why I bypassed it. The majority of Nollywood articles were created several years ago, when wikipedia obvously did not have strict rules like today, because if these articles would have been created today, they would surely be tagged for speedy deletion. Anybody who translates a tagged article is not doing wikipedia a favour, because in doing so all the mistakes, all the errors, and the low quality of that tagged article will be transfered to the new wiki of the translated language. So, in a nutshell,I will stick to those articles that have enough reliable sources, and I will also create new ones. Thanks very mucn for your assistance.

I left the [[WP:V]] in the edit summary simply because to me it doesnt make sense leaving messages on talk pages of dynamic IP-address. how effective is it leaving a message on a talk page of a dynamic IP address, when you know that the message most likely won't be read by the editor? My concern is to keep unsourced data out of wikipedia articles. When you look at the majority of nigeria-related articles (especially nigerian BLPs) you'll see that these articles contain loads of unsourced data which was added months/years back. when you now further trace the exact date when the unsourced information was added, you'll see that it was usually added via an IP-edit and remained there unchallenged ever since.<br />\n:btw Ricky, Surulere is a residential area within [[Lagos]], and has about 3 millions inhabitants :). cheers.

If ''anybody'' contests the deletion, including the page's creation, the proposed deletion fails. Prod also fails by definition if the page was previously under deletion discussion at AfD or previously deleted as a result of an expired prod. If nobody objects and seven days pass, the page is deleted by an admin. So, it's streamlined AfD, in a way; if prod fails, the person prodding the article will usually nominate it for deletion via AfD. —'''[[User:C.Fred|C.Fred]]''' ([[User_talk:C.Fred|talk]]) 18:22, 29 October 2009 (UTC)<br />\n:::::thanks very much for the info.

He was the first President to be born in the 19th century, not the second. See [[List of United States Presidents by date of birth]]. [[User:Aquila89|Aquila89]] ([[User talk:Aquila89|talk]]) 21:56, 3 November 2009 (UTC)<br />\n:According to wikipedia rules of adding content into articles, especially BLP articles, all added content must be [[WP:V|verifiable]], must be from [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable_sources |reliable sources]] with the appropriate [[WP:CS|citations]]. This is lacking in your edit. The wikipedia [[List of United States Presidents by date of birth|list of US american presidents]] does not contain any reference. The information about being the first or second president on both articles of the two presidents also do not contain any verifiable and reliable source. I suggest that you open a discussion about this issue on [[Talk:Franklin_Pierce|the articles' discussion page]] to try to get a consensus about this issue. [[User:Amsaim|Amsaim]] ([[User talk:Amsaim#top|talk]]) 22:17, 3 November 2009 (UTC)<br />\n<br />\n== Re [[Gamatadenuma]] ==<br />\n<br />\nI removed your G4 speedy deletion tag. G4 does not cover pages deleted by speedy deletion. It only covers pages deleted after discussion, i.e. AfD. Also, I noticed you cautioned the author for removing CSD tags, but I didn't see any edits where the author did that. [[User:Singularity42|Singularity42]] ([[User talk:Singularity42|talk]]) 04:29, 18 November 2009 (UTC)<br />\n:actually, G4 is listed at [[WP:CSD#G4|Wikipedia's Criteria For Speedy Deletion]]. The page was deleted by [[User:PMDrive1061|PMDrive1061]] via [[WP:CSD#G1]]. Two minutes after the deletion of the page, Rmtrbk created the same page again. It was during the first creation of the page page that Rmtrbk removed the speedy-deletion tag twice, and thus the caution was added on Rmtrbk's talk page. [[User:Amsaim|Amsaim]] ([[User talk:Amsaim#top|talk]]) 04:41, 18 November 2009 (UTC)<br />\n<br />\n::I think you misunderstand me. G4 is a speedy deletion criteria - to speedy delete something deleted after AfD, MfD, etc. Not to speedy delete something that has been speedy deleted before. As per the policy for G4: ''&quot;[G4] also excludes content undeleted via deletion review, deleted via proposed deletion, or to speedy deletions.&quot;'' [[User:Singularity42|Singularity42]] ([[User talk:Singularity42|talk]]) 04:45, 18 November 2009 (UTC)<br />\n:::it's all good. thanks for your observations. fact remains, that an [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;page=Gamatadenuma admin deleted the said article via WP:CSD#G1], and 2 minutes after the deletion, the same user recreated the same article. [[User:Amsaim|Amsaim]] ([[User talk:Amsaim#top|talk]]) 04:56, 18 November 2009 (UTC)<br />\n<br />\n::::Yep, it happens all the time. In most cases, just re-tag with the same speedy deletion as before, and caution the user with {{tl|uw-create2}} (or one of the higher levels if it is repeated). Eventually an admin willl [[WP:SALT]] the article. In this case, though, as other admins pointed out, G1 was incorrect in the first place, since G1 specifically excludes foreign-language articles. [[User:Singularity42|Singularity42]] ([[User talk:Singularity42|talk]]) 05:06, 18 November 2009 (UTC)<br />\n<br />\n== Speedy Deletion Criteria ==<br />\n<br />\nAfter making my above comments, I thought I would make a helpful comment regarding speedy deletion templates. It is very important to note that they have very narrow scopes, and should not be over-used. For example, A7 only covers individuals, animals, groups/organizations, and web content. Schools are specifically exempt from them, so you should not tag schools with A7. G11 is for obvious spam (i.e. &quot;Check out our website and buy our product. We have the best prices in the world!&quot;). If it appears to have the ulterior motive to promote a product, but is written in an encylopedic format, G11 does not apply.<br />\n<br />\nPROD is a great tool when something does not meet a speedy deletion criteria but is obviously not proper for Wikipedia, and one I find very handy as a new page patroller. If you have any questions, please let me know. [[User:Singularity42|Singularity42]] ([[User talk:Singularity42|talk]]) 04:42, 18 November 2009 (UTC)<br />\n<br />\n== [[James Gornall]] ==<br />\nHi, I see you reverted some edits of mine, not a problem in itself but you tagged them as vandalism.  The pages seems to an autobiography and is identical to the creators user pages, I redirected the page to its creators userpage and and requested its deletion as per the procedure for that sort of thing. If I made a mistake, fair enough but just to clrify, I was not vandalising the page [[User:GainLine|&lt;font face=&quot;jokerman&quot; color=&quot;navy&quot;&gt;'''G'''&lt;small&gt;&lt;s&gt;ain&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/small&gt;'''Line '''&lt;/font&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/GainLine|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;♠&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sub&gt; [[User talk:GainLine|&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;♥&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sub&gt; 14:46, 19 November 2009 (UTC)<br />\n:The edits of the BLP article were tagged as vandalism because the redirect to the userpage wasnt't correct. The copy of the created article on the editor's page doesn't justify the redirect. There could be several reasons why the editor has a copy of the article which he created on his user page. Using [[WP:AGF]] there is no evidence for an autobiography. Thank you. [[User:Amsaim|Amsaim]] ([[User talk:Amsaim#top|talk]]) 15:35, 19 November 2009 (UTC)<br />\n:: As you are quoting AGF, I would remind you to apply it to my edits, if there were errors then please say so in the edit summary. Please do not label me as a vandal.  Applying [[WP:QUACK]] the article is James Gornall and says the nickname of the subject is JIGGY, the creators username is JIGGY G and the article is recreated as their userpage. This all points to a self-bio. I believe it would have been better for an admin to have a look at this and make a decision.  [[User:GainLine|&lt;font face=&quot;jokerman&quot; color=&quot;navy&quot;&gt;'''G'''&lt;small&gt;&lt;s&gt;ain&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/small&gt;'''Line '''&lt;/font&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/GainLine|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;♠&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sub&gt; [[User talk:GainLine|&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;♥&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sub&gt; 15:49, 19 November 2009 (UTC)<br />\n:::I have not labelled you as a vandal. If the impression has been created, pls accept my apologies. [[User:Amsaim|Amsaim]] ([[User talk:Amsaim#top|talk]])<br />\n:::: The edit summary ''(Reverted 3 edits by GainLine identified as vandalism to last revision by JIGGY G. (TW)) '' sort of gave that impression. Truth be told there was a time when you would have been right but nowadays I'm on the other side of the fence. Sorry if I came across as a bit short.  I'm going to place a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{coi}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag on the page as I do believe it is an autobiography. [[User:GainLine|&lt;font face=&quot;jokerman&quot; color=&quot;navy&quot;&gt;'''G'''&lt;small&gt;&lt;s&gt;ain&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/small&gt;'''Line '''&lt;/font&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/GainLine|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;♠&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sub&gt; [[User talk:GainLine|&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;♥&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sub&gt; 16:09, 19 November 2009 (UTC)</div>",

    "description": "<p>Gregology: /* External links */</p>\n<hr />\n<div>:''For other uses of &quot;Martyr&quot; and &quot;Martyrs&quot;, see [[Martyr (disambiguation)]].''<br />\n[[Image:St-Sebastian-xx-Guido-Reni.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Saint Sebastian]], an iconic image of martyrdom]]<br />\nA '''martyr''' ([[language|Greek]]: μάρτυς, ''mártys'', &quot;witness&quot;; [[Word stem|stem]] μάρτυρ-, ''mártyr-'') is somebody who suffers [[persecution]] and death for refusing to renounce a belief, usually religious.<br />\n<br />\n==Meaning==<br />\nIn its original meaning, the word '''martyr''', meaning [[witness]], was used in the secular sphere as well as in both the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]] of the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Alison A. Trites, ''The New Testament Concept of Witness'', ISBN 0-521-60934-8 and ISBN 9780521609340.&lt;/ref&gt; The process of bearing witness was not intended to lead to the death of the witness, although it is known from ancient writers (e.g. [[Josephus]]) that witnesses, especially of the lower classes, were tortured routinely before being interrogated as a means of forcing them to disclose the truth. <br />\n<br />\nDuring the early Christian centuries, the term acquired the extended meaning of a believer who is called to witness for their religious belief, and on account of this witness, endures suffering and/or death. The term, in this later sense, entered the [[English language]] as a [[loanword]]. The death of a martyr or the value attributed to it is called '''martyrdom'''.<br />\n<br />\n==Christianity==<br />\n{{main|Christian martyrs}}<br />\nIn the context of church history, from the time of the persecution of [[early Christianity|early Christian]]s in the [[Roman Empire]], being a martyr indicates a person who is killed for maintaining a [[religion|religious]] belief, ''knowing'' that this will almost certainly result in imminent death (though without intentionally seeking [[death]]). Martyrs sometimes declined to defend themselves at all, in what they see as a reflection of [[Jesus]]' willing sacrifice. However, the definition of martyrdom is not specifically restricted to the Christian faith.<br />\n<br />\nSome Christians view death in [[sectarian]] persecution as martyrdom. This view is typified by the accounts in [[Foxe's Book of Martyrs]].<br />\n<br />\nUsage of &quot;martyr&quot; is also common among [[Arab Christians]] (i.e. anyone killed in relation to Christianity or a Christian community), indicating that the English word &quot;martyr&quot; may not actually be a proper equivalent of its commonly ascribed Arabic translation.<br />\n<br />\n==Judaism==<br />\n{{Main|Martyrdom in Judaism}}<br />\nMartyrdom in [[Judaism]] is one of the main examples of [[Kiddush Hashem]], meaning &quot;sanctification of God's name&quot; through public dedication to Jewish practice.<br />\n<br />\n==Islam==<br />\n{{main|Shahid}}<br />\nIn Arabic, a martyr is termed &quot;[[shahid]]&quot; (literally, &quot;witness,&quot; as in the Greek root of the English word). The word ''shaheed'' appears in the Quran in a variety of contexts, including witnessing to righteousness ([http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/quran/002.qmt.html Quran 2:143]), witnessing a financial transaction ([http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/quran/002.qmt.html Quran 2:282]) and being killed, even in an accident as long as it doesn't happen with the intention to commit a sin, when they are believed to remain alive making them witnesses over worldly events without taking part in them anymore([http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/quran/003.qmt.html Quran 3:140]). The word also appears with these various meanings in the [[Hadith]], the sayings of [[Muhammad]].<br />\n<br />\n==Hinduism==<br />\n<br />\nDespite the promotion of [[ahimsa]] within [[Sanatana Dharma]], there is also the concept of righteous or [[religious war]] in [[Hinduism]] known as [[Dharmayuddha]], where [[violence]] is used as a last resort after all other means have failed. Examples of this include in the [[Mahabharata]], where [[Krishna]] instructs [[Arjuna]] to carry out his duty as a [[warrior]] and fight, and in the [[Ramayana]] where [[Ravana]] is defeated by [[Rama]]. [[Martyrdom]] in battle is seen as highly noble in [[Hinduism]], which is evident in the [[Bhagavad Gita]] where [[Krishna]] states &lt;blockquote&gt;Either being slain you will attain the heavenly worlds or by gaining victory you will enjoy the earthly kingdom; therefore O Arjuna, rise up and fight.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-02-37.html&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br />\nThe notion of &quot;Martyrdom&quot; in Hinduism has been praised for figures like [[Rama]] and [[Arjuna]] in [[Pauranic]] scripture. However, [[Rama]] is regarded as a God among [[Vaishnavite]]s and [[Arjuna]] as the son of a God (according to the [[Mahabharata]], all the [[Pandava]] brothers were conceived by Hindu Gods due to the impotence of [[Pandu]]). There has never been an edict or declaration in Hinduism that mortal men may embrace martyrdom.<br />\n<br />\n==Bahá'í faith==<br />\n{{main|Martyrdom in the Bahá'í Faith}}<br />\n<br />\nIn the [[Bahá'í Faith]], a martyr is one who sacrifices their life serving humanity in the name of God.&lt;ref name=&quot;winters_conclusion&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title =Dying for God: Martyrdom in the Shii and Babi Religions | first = Jonah | last = Winters | date = 1997-09-19 | accessdate = 2007-01-23 | chapter = Conclusion | url =  http://bahai-library.com/theses/dying/dying8.conclusion.html | publisher = M.A. Thesis}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, discouraged the literal meaning of sacrificing one's life, and instead explained that martyrdom is devoting oneself to service to humanity.&lt;ref name=&quot;winters_conclusion&quot; /&gt;<br />\n<br />\n==Sikhism==<br />\n&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Arjan11.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Picture showing Guru Arjan Dev subjected to torture by the Mughals|{{deletable image-caption|1=Monday, 5 May 2008}}]] --&gt;<br />\n{{Main|Martyrdom in Sikhism}}<br />\nMartyrdom, in [[Sikhism]], is a fundamental concept, and represents an important institution of the faith.<br />\n<br />\n==Notes==<br />\n[[Image:Allepeymartyrscolumn.JPG|thumb|right|A communist 'martyrs column' in [[Alappuzha]], [[India]]]]<br />\n{{reflist}}<br />\n<br />\n==See also==<br />\n*[[Christian martyrs]]<br />\n*[[Martyr (shahid)]] <br />\n*[[Martyrology]] <br />\n*[[Perpetua and Felicity]]<br />\n*[[Religious persecution]]<br />\n*[[Martyr complex]]<br />\n<br />\n==References==<br />\n*[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09736b.htm  ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' &quot;Martyrs&quot;]<br />\n*Foster, Claude R. jr.: Paul Schneider, the Buchenwald apostle : a Christian martyr in Nazi Germany ; a sourcebook on the German Church struggle; Westchester, Pennsylvania: SSI Bookstore, West Chester University, 1995; ISBN 1-887732-01-2<br />\n<br />\n==External links==<br />\n{{Wiktionary}}<br />\n*[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/foxe/martyrs.html ''Fox's Book of Martyrs''] 16th century classic book, accounts of martyrdoms, full text.<br />\n*[http://www.cqpress.com/incontext/terrorism/links/epr_martyrdom.html Martyrdom] from the perspecive of [[sociology]]-''Encyclopedia of Politics and Religion''<br />\n<br />\n{{Death}}<br />\n<br />\n&lt;!--Categories--&gt;<br />\n[[Category:Martyrs| ]]<br />\n[[Category:Christian philosophy]]<br />\n[[Category:Jewish philosophy]]<br />\n[[Category:Islamic philosophy]]<br />\n[[Category:Greek loanwords]]<br />\n<br />\n&lt;!--Other languages--&gt;<br />\n[[ar:شهيد]]<br />\n[[az:Şəhid]]<br />\n[[br:Merzher]]<br />\n[[bg:Мъченик]]<br />\n[[ca:Màrtir]]<br />\n[[cs:Mučedník]]<br />\n[[cy:Merthyr]]<br />\n[[da:Martyr]]<br />\n[[de:Märtyrer]]<br />\n[[et:Märter]]<br />\n[[es:Mártir]]<br />\n[[eo:Martiro]]<br />\n[[fa:شهید]]<br />\n[[fr:Martyr]]<br />\n[[ko:순교]]<br />\n[[hr:Mučenik]]<br />\n[[id:Syahid]]<br />\n[[is:Píslarvottur]]<br />\n[[it:Martire]]<br />\n[[he:מרטיר]]<br />\n[[la:Martyr]]<br />\n[[hu:Vértanú]]<br />\n[[nl:Martelaar]]<br />\n[[ja:殉教]]<br />\n[[no:Martyr]]<br />\n[[nn:Martyr]]<br />\n[[nds:Merteler]]<br />\n[[pl:Martyrologia]]<br />\n[[pt:Mártir]]<br />\n[[ro:Martir]]<br />\n[[ru:Мученик]]<br />\n[[sco:Mairtyr]]<br />\n[[simple:Martyr]]<br />\n[[sk:Mučeník]]<br />\n[[fi:Marttyyri]]<br />\n[[sv:Martyr]]<br />\n[[tr:Şehit]]<br />\n[[uk:Мученик]]<br />\n[[zh:殉教]]</div>",

In the old days, people used to sool their [[dingo|dogs]] on them and spear them. The milk guts are pulled out and a wooden skewer is used to close up the carcase.  Then it is tossed on top of the fire to singe the hair which is scraped off, and then it's (put in a hole and) covered up with hot earth and coals.  The tail and both feet are cut off before cooking. These are put in together with the rest of the carcase.&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br />\n<br />\n&lt;blockquote&gt;The kangaroo is chopped up so that many people can eat it.  The warm blood and fluids from the gluteus medius and the hollow of the thoracic cavity are drained of all fluids. People drink these fluids, which studies have shown are quite harmless.  Kangaroos are cut in a special way; into the two thighs, the two hips, the two sides of ribs, the stomach, the head, the tail, the two feet, the back and lower back.

The term larboard continued its use well into the 1850s by [[whaler]]s, despite the term being long superseded by &quot;port&quot; in the merchant vessel service at the time. <br />\n<br />\nThe term &quot;port&quot; was not officially adopted by the [[Royal Navy]] until 1844 ([[Ray Parkin]], ''H. M. Bark Endeavour''). [[Robert FitzRoy]], Captain of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] ''[[HMS Beagle]]'', is said to have taught his crew to use the term port instead of larboard, thus propelling the use of the word into the Naval Services vocabulary. Another source suggests a different archaic word &quot;portboard&quot; (see the [[starboard]] article for further explanation). <br />\n<br />\nThe word ''starboard'' comes from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''steorbord'', literally meaning the side on which the ship is steered. The old English term ''stēorbord'' descends from the [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] words ''stýri'' meaning “rudder” (from the verb ''stýra'', literally “being at the helm”, “having a hand in”) and ''borð'' meaning etymologically “board”, then the “side of a ship”.<br />\n<br />\nIn many languages, other than English, the word is derived from a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] term akin to &quot;backboard&quot;, from the same roots as English &quot;back&quot; and &quot;board&quot;.<br />\n<br />\nA ''port buoy'' is a [[lateral buoy]] used to guide vessels through channels or close to shallow water. The port buoy is one that a vessel must leave to port when passing upstream.  If in [[International Association of Lighthouse Authorities|IALA]] area A, the port buoys are red. If in IALA area B (Japan, the Americas, South Korea, and the Philippines) then the 'handedness' of buoyage is reversed, and black or green buoys are left to port. <br />\n<br />\nShips and aircraft carry a red light on the port side, and a green one on the starboard side, plus a white light at the rear. <br />\n<br />\nThere are a number of tricks used to remember port and starboard:<br />\n<br />\n* The simplest being &quot;no port left&quot;<br />\n* Port is to the left facing forward; &quot;port&quot; and &quot;left&quot; each have four letters.<br />\n* Similar to above, all are short words (&quot;port&quot;, &quot;left&quot;, and &quot;red&quot;) while other side long words (&quot;starboard&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, and &quot;green&quot;)<br />\n* Also the phrase &quot;Any '''red port left''' in the can?&quot; can be a useful reminder. It breaks down as follows: - Port, the drink, is a fortified red wine which links the word port with the colour red, used for the navigation lights (see below). &quot;left&quot; comes from the phrase and so port must be on the left. The reference to &quot;can&quot; relates to the fact that port-hand harbour buoys are &quot;can&quot; shaped (only in IALA region A)<br />\n* A variation on the above is &quot;Two drops of '''red port left''' in the bottle.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nFor buoys in IALA B:<br />\n* '''B'''est '''P'''eople '''O'''n '''E'''arth - Black Port on Entering<br />\n* '''RRR''' - Red Right Returning<br />\n<br />\n==See also==<br />\n*[[Bow (ship)|Bow]]<br />\n*[[Port Out, Starboard Home|Posh]]<br />\n*[[Starboard]]<br />\n*[[Stern]]<br />\n<br />\n== References ==<br />\n{{reflist}}<br />\n<br />\n==External links==<br />\n*[http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.17900 The origins of 'port' and 'starboard' at the UK National Maritime Museum website]<br />\n<br />\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Port (Nautical)}}<br />\n[[Category:Nautical terms]]<br />\n[[Category:Orientation]]<br />\n<br />\n[[af:Bakboord]]<br />\n[[ca:Babord]]<br />\n[[da:Bagbord]]<br />\n[[de:Backbord]]<br />\n[[et:Pakpoord]]<br />\n[[es:Babor]]<br />\n[[eo:Babordo]]<br />\n[[eu:Ababor]]<br />\n[[fr:Bâbord]]<br />\n[[nl:Bakboord en stuurboord]]<br />\n[[ja:取舵]]<br />\n[[no:Babord]]<br />\n[[nn:Babord]]<br />\n[[nds:Backboord]]<br />\n[[pl:Burta (statek wodny)]]<br />\n[[sv:Babord]]<br />\n[[tr:İskele (gemi)]]</div>",

The group used to have a very hierarchical organization with a leading figure at the top, delegating into three substructures: the logistical, military and political sections. Reports from Spanish and French police point towards significant changes in ETA's structures in recent years. ETA has divided the three substructures into a total of eleven. The change was a response to recent captures, and possible infiltration, by the different law enforcement agencies. ETA's intention is to disperse its members and reduce the impact of detentions.<br />\n<br />\nThe leading committee is formed by 7 to 11 individuals, and ETA's internal documentation refers to it as Zuba, an abbreviation of ''Zuzendaritza Batzordea'' (directorial committee). There is another committee named ''Zuba-hitu'' that functions as an advisory committee.

Defenders of the new law argue that the ''Ley de Partidos'' does not necessarily require responses to individual acts of violence, but rather a declaration of principles explicitly rejecting violence as a means of achieving political goals. Defenders also argue that the ban of a political party is subject to judicial process, with all the guarantees of the State of Law. Batasuna has failed to produce such a statement {{As of|2008|alt=as of February 2008}}. Other political parties linked to terrorist organizations like the [[Communist Party of Spain (Reconstituted)|''Partido Comunista de España (reconstituido)'']] have also been declared illegal, and [[Acción Nacionalista Vasca]] and [[Communist Party of the Basque Lands]] (EHAK/PCTV, ''Euskal Herrialdeetako Alderdi Komunista / Partido Comunista de las Tierras Vascas'') have been illegalized in September 2008.<br />\n<br />\nA new party called [[Aukera Guztiak]] ''(All the Options)'' was formed expressly for the elections to the [[Basque Parliament]] of April 2005. Its supporters claimed no heritage from Batasuna, asserting that their aim was to allow Basque citizens to freely express their political ideas, even those of independence. On the matter of political violence, Aukera Guztiak stated their right not to condemn some kinds of violence more than others if they did not see fit (in this regard, the [[Basque National Liberation Movement|Basque National Liberation Movement (MLNV)]] regards present police actions as violence, torture and state terrorism). Nevertheless, most of their members and certainly most of their leadership were former Batasuna supporters or affiliates. The Spanish Supreme Court unanimously considered the party to be a sequel to Batasuna and declared a ban on it.<br />\n<br />\nAfter Aukera Guztiak had been banned, and less than two weeks before the election, another political group appeared born from an earlier schism from Herri Batasuna, the [[Communist Party of the Basque Lands]] (EHAK/PCTV, ''Euskal Herrialdeetako Alderdi Komunista / Partido Comunista de las Tierras Vascas''), a formerly unknown political party which had no representation in the Autonomous Basque Parliament. EHAK made the announcement that they would apply the votes they obtained to sustain the political programme of the now banned Aukera Guztiak platform. This move left no time for the Spanish courts to investigate EHAK in compliance with the ''Ley de Partidos'' before the elections were held.

Started in 1952 as a student discussion group at the [[University of Deusto]] in [[Bilbao]], an offshoot of the PNV's youth group [[EGI]], it was originally called [[EKIN]], from the Basque-language verb meaning &quot;to act&quot;; the name had the meaning &quot;get busy&quot;.  On July 31, 1959 it reconstituted itself as ETA. Their split from the PNV was apparently because they considered the PNV too moderate in its opposition to Franco's dictatorship. They disagreed with the PNV's rejection of violent tactics and advocated a Basque [[resistance movement]] using [[direct action]]. This was an era of [[wars of national liberation]] such as the [[decolonization|anti-colonial]] war in [[Algeria]].<br />\n<br />\nIn their platform, formed at their first assembly in [[Bayonne]], [[France]] in 1962, ETA called for &quot;historical regenerationism&quot;, viewing Basque history as a process of [[nation building]]. They declared that Basque nationality is defined by the Basque language; this was in contrast to the PNV's definition of Basque nationality in terms of [[ethnicity]]. In contrast with the explicit Catholicism of the PNV, ETA defined itself as &quot;aconfessional&quot;—meaning ETA does not recognize a special state religion—although using Catholic doctrine to elaborate its social program. They called for socialism and for &quot;independence for Euskadi, compatible with European [[federalist|federalism]]&quot;.<br />\n<br />\nIn 1965, the sixth Assembly of ETA adopted a [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] position; its precise political line has varied with time, although they have always advocated some [[Types of socialism|type of socialism]].<br />\n<br />\nIn its early years, ETA's activity seems to have consisted mostly of theorizing and of protesting by destroying infrastructure and Spanish symbols and by hanging forbidden [[Basque flag]]s.<br />\n<br />\n[[Image:Placa Carrero Blanco.jpg|thumb|Memorial plate at the place of the assassination of Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco.]]<br />\nIt is not clear when exactly ETA first began a policy of assassination, nor is it clear who committed the first assassinations identified with ETA. There are sources that single out a failed 1960 attempt to derail a train carrying war veterans as a result of which the little girl Beatriz Urroz was killed, this attack was not vindicated by ETA or any other group. The first confirmed assassination occurred on June 7, 1968 when [[Guardia Civil (Spain)|Guardia Civil]], [[José Pardines Arcay]] was shot dead when he tried to halt ETA member [[Txabi Etxebarrieta]] during the course of a routine [[road check]]. Etxebarrieta was chased down and killed as he tried to flee&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/primer/dia/ETA/asesino/elpepuesp/20080604elpepunac_4/Tes&lt;/ref&gt;.

The assassination had been planned for months and was executed by placing a bomb in the sewer below the street where Blanco's car passed every day. The bomb blew up just in time and threw the politician and his car three floors into the air and over the top of a nearby building; the car landed on a balcony in a courtyard the other side from the road.<br />\n<br />\nThis killing was not condemned and in some cases was even applauded by the Spanish opposition in exile. For some Carrero Blanco's death was an instrumental step for the subsequent establishment of [[democracy]], by eliminating Franco's chosen successor. In regard to Carrero's death, the former ETA member now turned anti-nationalist author [[Jon Juaristi]] contends that ETA's goal with this particular killing was not democratization but a spiral of violence as an attempt to fully destabilize Spain, increase Franco's repression against Basque nationalism and subsequently put the average citizen in the Basque country in a situation where they would have had to accept the [[Lesser of two evils principle|lesser evil]] in the form of ETA's reaction against Franco's unleashed repression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Juaristi Némesis Carrero&quot;&gt;''Sacra Némesis: Nuevas historias de nacionalistas vascos'', pages 143-145, [[Jon Juaristi]], [[Editorial Espasa Calpe]], 1999, ISBN 84-239-7791-9&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\n=== During the transition ===<br />\nAfter Franco's death, during the [[Spanish transition to democracy]], ETA split into two separate organisations: one faction became [[ETA political-military]] or ETA(pm), and another [[ETA military]] or ETA(m).<br />\n<br />\nBoth ETA(m) and ETA(pm) refused offers of amnesty, instead continuing and intensifying their violent struggle. The years 1978&amp;ndash;80 were to prove ETA's most deadly, with 68, 76, and 91 fatalities, respectively. [Martinez-Herrera 2002]<br />\n<br />\nDuring the Franco dictatorship, ETA was able to take advantage of tolerance by the [[French government]], which allowed its members to move freely through French territory, believing that in this manner they were contributing to the end of Franco's regime. There is much controversy over the degree to which this policy of &quot;[[sanctuary]]&quot; continued even after the transition to democracy, but it is generally agreed that currently the French authorities collaborate closely with the Spanish government against ETA.<br />\n<br />\nIn the 80s, ETA(pm) accepted the Spanish government's offer of individual pardons to all ETA prisoners, even those who had committed violent crimes, who publicly abandoned the policy of violence. This caused a new division in ETA(pm) between the seventh and eighth assemblies. ETA VII accepted this partial amnesty granted by the now democratic Spanish government and integrated into the political party ''[[Euskadiko Ezkerra]]'' (&quot;[[left-wing politics|Left]] of the Basque Country&quot;).<br />\n<br />\nETA VIII, after a brief period of independent activity, eventually integrated into ETA(m), possibly influencing ETA(m) into adopting even more radical and violent positions. With no factions existing anymore, ETA(m) revamped the original name of Euskadi Ta Askatasuna.<br />\n<br />\n==== GAL ====<br />\nDuring the 1980s a &quot;[[dirty war]]&quot; ensued by means of the [[Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberación]] (GAL, &quot;Antiterrorist Liberation Groups&quot;), a [[paramilitary]] group which billed themselves as [[counter-terrorist]], active between 1983 and 1987. The GAL committed assassinations, kidnappings and torture, not only of ETA members but of civilians supposedly related to those, some of whom turned out to have nothing to do with ETA. 27 people were murdered by GAL.&lt;ref name=&quot;santamaria437&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Diego Carcedo]] | title=Sáenz de Santa María.

Yoyes was a former member of ETA who had abandoned the armed struggle and rejoined civil society: they accused her of &quot;desertion&quot; because of her taking advantage of the Spanish ''reinserción'' policy which granted amnesty to those prisoners who publicly refused political violence (see below).<br />\n<br />\nOn January 12, 1988 all Basque political parties except ETA-affiliated [[Batasuna|Herri Batasuna]] signed the [[Ajuria-Enea pact]] with the intent of ending ETA's violence. Weeks later on January 28, ETA announced a 60-day &quot;ceasefire&quot;, later prolonged several times. Negotiations known as the [[Mesa de Argel]] (&quot;[[Algiers]] Table&quot;) took place between the ETA representative [[Eugenio Etxebeste]] (&quot;Antxon&quot;), and the then PSOE government of Spain but no successful conclusion was reached, and ETA eventually resumed the use of violence.<br />\n<br />\nDuring this period, the Spanish government had a policy referred to as &quot;[[reinsertion]]&quot;, under which imprisoned ETA members whom the government believed had genuinely abandoned violence could be freed and allowed to rejoin society. Claiming a need to prevent ETA from coercively impeding this reinsertion, the PSOE government decided that imprisoned ETA members, who previously had all been imprisoned within the Basque Country, would instead be dispersed to prisons throughout Spain, some as far from their families as in the [[Salto del Negro]] prison in the [[Canary Islands]]. France has taken a similar approach. In the event, the only clear effect of this policy was to incite social protest, especially from nationalists and families of the prisoners, claiming cruelty of separating family members from the insurgents. Much of the protest against this policy runs under the slogan &quot;''Euskal presoak - Euskal Herrira''&quot; (''Basque prisoners to the Basque Country'', by &quot;Basque prisoners&quot; only ETA members are meant). It has to be noted that almost in any Spanish jail there is a group of ETA prisoners, as the number of ETA prisoners makes it difficult to disperse them.<br />\n''[[Gestoras pro-Amnistía]]/[[Amnistia Aldeko Batzordeak]]'' (&quot;Pro-Amnesty Managing Assemblies&quot;, currently illegal), later ''[[Askatasuna]]'' (&quot;Freedom&quot;) and ''[[Senideak]]'' (&quot;The family members&quot;) provide support for prisoners and families.<br />\nThe [[Basque Government]] and several Nationalist town halls grant money on humanitarian reasons for relatives to visit prisoners.<br />\nThe long road trips had caused accidental deaths that are protested against by ETA supporters.<br />\n<br />\nDuring the ETA ceasefire of the late 1990s, the PSOE government brought back to the mainland the prisoners on the islands and in [[Africa]]&lt;!-- Is this Ceuta and Melilla? --&gt;{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}. Since the end of the ceasefire, ETA prisoners have not been sent back to overseas prisons. Some Basque authorities have established grants for the expenses of visiting families.<br />\n<br />\nAnother Spanish &quot;counter-terrorist&quot; law puts suspected terrorist cases under the central tribunal ''[[Audiencia Nacional]]'' in [[Madrid]], due to the threats by the group over the Basque courts. Under Article 509 suspected terrorists are subject to being held &quot;incommunicado&quot; for up to thirteen days, during which they have no contact with the outside world other than through the court appointed lawyer, including informing their family of their arrest, consultation with private lawyers or examination by a physician other than the [[coroner]]s. In comparison the [[habeas corpus]] term for other suspects is three days.<br />\n<br />\nIn 1992, ETA's three top leaders &amp;mdash; &quot;military&quot; leader [[Francisco Mujika Garmendia]] (&quot;Pakito&quot;), political leader [[José Luis Alvarez Santacristina]] (&quot;Txelis&quot;) and logistical leader [[José María Arregi Erostarbe]] (&quot;Fiti&quot;), often referred to collectively as the &quot;cúpula&quot; of ETA or as the Artapalo collective &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informativos.telecinco.es/dn_16360.htm Informativos Telecinco.com - Internacional - Trece muertos y más de cincuenta heridos en dos atentados suicidas en Bangladesh&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; were arrested in the northern Basque town of [[Bidart]], which led to changes in ETA's leadership and direction. After a two-month truce, ETA adopted even more radical positions. The principal consequence of the change appears to have been the creation of the ''&quot;[[Y Groups]]&quot;'', formed by young militants of ETA parallel organisations (generally [[minor (law)|minors]]), dedicated to so-called ''&quot;kale borroka&quot;'' &amp;mdash; street struggle &amp;mdash; and whose activities included burning buses, street lamps, benches, [[Automatic teller machine|ATM]]s, garbage containers, and throwing [[Molotov cocktail]]s. The appearance of these groups was attributed by many to the supposed weakness of ETA, which obliged them to resort to minors to maintain or augment their impact on society after arrests of leading militants, including the &quot;cupola&quot;. ETA also began to menace leaders of other parties besides rival Basque nationalist parties.<br />\n<br />\nIn 1995, the armed organization again launched a peace proposal. The so-called &quot;Democratic Alternative&quot; replaced the earlier [[Koordinadora Abertzale Sozialista|KAS]] Alternative as a minimum proposal for the establishment of Euskal Herria. The Democratic Alternative offered the cessation of all armed ETA activity if the Spanish-government would recognize the Basque people as having sovereignty over Basque territory, the right to [[self-determination]] and that it freed all ETA members in prison. The Spanish government ultimately rejected this peace offer as it would go against the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]]. Changing the constitution was not considered.<br />\n<br />\nAlso in 1995 came a failed ETA car bombing attempt directed against [[José María Aznar]], a [[conservatism|conservative]] politician who was leader of the then-opposition [[People's Party (Spain)|Partido Popular]] (PP) and was shortly after elected to the presidency of the government; there was also an abortive attempt in [[Majorca]] on the life of King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos I]]. Still, the act with the largest social impact came the following year. July 10, 1997 PP council member [[Miguel Ángel Blanco]] was kidnapped in the Basque town of [[Ermua]], with the separatist group threatening to assassinate him unless the Spanish government met ETA's demand of starting to bring all ETA's inmates to prisons of the Basque Country within two days after the kidnapping. This demand wasn't met by the Spanish government and after three days Miguel Ángel Blanco was found shot dead when the deadline expired. More than six million people took out to the streets to demand his liberation, with massive demonstrations occurring as much in the Basque regions as elsewhere in Spain, chanting cries of &quot;Assassins&quot; and &quot;Basques yes, ETA no&quot;. This response came to be known as the &quot;Spirit of Ermua&quot;.<br />\n<br />\nLater came acts of violence such as the November 6, 2001 car bomb in Madrid, which injured sixty-five, and attacks on [[soccer]] stadiums and tourist destinations.<br />\n<br />\nThe [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] appeared to have dealt a hard blow to ETA, owing to the toughening of &quot;antiterrorist&quot; measures (such as the freezing of bank accounts), the increase in international police coordination, and the end of the toleration some countries had, up until then, extended to ETA. In addition, in 2002 the Basque nationalist youth movement [[Jarrai]] was outlawed and the law of parties was changed outlawing Herri Batasuna, the &quot;political arm&quot; of ETA (although even before the change in law, Batasuna had been largely paralysed and under judicial investigation by judge [[Baltasar Garzón]]).<br />\n<br />\nWith ever-increasing frequency, attempted ETA actions have been frustrated by Spanish security forces.<br />\n<br />\nOn Christmas Eve 2003, in San Sebastián and in [[Hernani]], National Police arrested two ETA members who had left dynamite in a railroad car prepared to explode in [[Chamartín Station]] in Madrid.

These bombs have sometimes killed family members of ETA's target victim and bystanders. When the bombs are car-bombs seeking to produce large damage and terror, they are generally announced by one or more telephone calls made to newspapers speaking in the name of ETA. Charities (usually [[Detente Y Ayuda]]—DYA) have also been used to announce the threat if the bomb is in a populated area.

This loose term refers to a range of political organizations that are ideologically akin, comprising several distinct organizations that promote a type of [[left-wing politics|leftist]] Basque nationalism that is often referred to by the Basque-language term ''Ezker [[Abertzale]]a'' (Nationalist Left).  Other groups typically considered to belong to this independentist movement are: the political party [[Batasuna]], the nationalist youth organization [[Segi]], the labour union [[Langile Abertzaleen Batzordeak]] (LAB), and [[Askatasuna]] among others. There are often strong interconnections between these groups, double or even triple membership are not unfrequent&lt;ref name = &quot;jvjtfe&quot;/&gt;.<br />\n<br />\nThere are Basque nationalist parties with similar goals as those of ETA (namely, independence) but who openly reject their violent means. They are: [[EAJ-PNV]], [[Eusko Alkartasuna]], [[Aralar Party|Aralar]] and, in the [[French Basque country]], [[Abertzaleen Batasuna]]. In addition a number of left-wing parties, such as [[Izquierda Unida|Ezker Batua]], [[Batzarre]] and some sectors of the [[EAJ-PNV]] party, also support self-determination but are not in favour of independence.<br />\n<br />\n== French role ==<br />\nHistorically, members of ETA have taken refuge in France, particularly the [[French Basque Country]]. The leadership have typically chosen to live in France for security reasons, where police pressure is much less than in Spain.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/1386545/Payback-for-Eta-in-the-Pays-Basque.html&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, ETA's tactical approach had been to downplay the issue of independence of the French Basque country so as to get French acquiescence for their activities. The [[French government]] quietly tolerated the group, especially during [[Francoist Spain|Franco's regime]], when ETA members could face the [[death penalty]] in Spain. In the 1980s, the advent of the [[Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberación|GAL]] still hindered [[counter-terrorist]] cooperation between the France and Spain, with the French government considering ETA a Spanish domestic problem. At the time, ETA members often travelled to and fro between the two countries using the French sanctuary as a base for operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.france24.com/en/20080926-spain-basque-separatism-batasuna-eta]&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\nWith the disbanding of the GAL, the French government considered that detainees' rights were being adequately defended in Spain. France changed its position in the matter and initiated in the 1990s the ongoing period of active cooperation with the Spanish government against ETA, including fast-track transfers of detainees to Spanish tribunals that are regarded as fully compliant with [[European Union]] legislation in [[human rights]] and the legal representation of detainees. Virtually all of the highest ranks within ETA –including their successive &quot;military&quot;, &quot;political&quot; or finances chiefs– have been captured in French territory, from where they had been plotting their activities after having crossed the border from Spain.<br />\n<br />\nIn response to the new situation, ETA carried out attacks against French policemen and made threats to some French judges and prosecutors. This implied a change from the organization's previous low-profile in the French Basque Country, which successive ETA leaders had used to discreetly managing their activities in Spain&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt;.<br />\n<br />\n==Government response==<br />\nETA considers its prisoners [[political prisoner]]s. Until 2003,&lt;ref&gt;''ETA pide el tercer grado para sus presos'' [[Libertad Digital]], 5 October 2003, quoted in {{PDFlink|[http://www.bastaya.org/actualidad/Violencia/InformeTorturas/Ladispersiondelospresosdeeta.pdf La dispersión de los presos de ETA]|47.2&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]&lt;!-- application/pdf, 48384 bytes --&gt;}} (page 9), a [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] in the [[¡Basta Ya!]] site.&lt;/ref&gt; ETA consequently forbade them to ask penal authorities for progression to ''tercer grado'' (a form of [[open prison]] that allows single-day or weekend [[furlough]]s) or [[parole]]. Before that date, those who did so were menaced and expelled from the group. Some were assassinated by ETA for leaving the band and going through reinsertion programs&lt;ref name = &quot;hizrqw&quot;/&gt;.<br />\n<br />\nA more recent tactic of the Spanish Governments' campaign against ETA has been to target its social support network.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} The most important measure has been the passing of the ''Ley de Partidos Políticos''. This is a law barring political parties which support violence, don't condemn terrorist actions or are involved with terrorist groups &lt;ref name=&quot;Ley 6/2002&quot;&gt;[http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Admin/lo6-2002.html Ley Orgánica 6/2002, de 27 de junio]&lt;/ref&gt;. The law has resulted in the banning of [[Herri Batasuna]] and its successor parties unless they condemn explicitly terrorist actions and, at times, imprisoning or trying some of its leaders who have been indicted for cooperation with ETA.<br />\n<br />\nJudge [[Baltasar Garzón]] has initiated a judicial procedure (coded as ''18/98''), aimed towards the support structure of ETA. This procedure started in 1998 with the preventive closure of the newspaper ''[[Egin]]'' (and its associated radio-station ''Egin Irratia''), accused of being linked to ETA, and temporary imprisoning the editor of its &quot;investigative unit&quot;, [[Pepe Rei]], under similar accusations. In August 1999 Judge [[Baltasar Garzón]] authorized the reopening of the newspaper and the radio, but they coulndn't reopen due to economic difficulties.<br />\n<br />\nJudicial procedure 18/98 has many ramifications, including the following:<br />\n<br />\n* A trial against a little-known organization called ''[[Xaki]]'', acquitted in 2001 as the &quot;international network&quot; of ETA.<br />\n* A trial against the youths' movement ''[[Jarrai]]''-''Haika''-''Segi'', accused of contributing to street violence in an organized form and in connivance with ETA.<br />\n* Another trial against [[Pepe Rei]] and his new investigation magazine ''Ardi Beltza'' (''Black Sheep'').

Initially these reforms included the introduction of [[set-aside]] in 1988, where a proportion of farm land was deliberately withdrawn from production, milk quotas (by the McSharry reforms in 1992) and, more recently, the 'de-coupling' (or disassociation) of the money farmers receive from the EU and the amount they produce (by the Fischler reforms in 2004). Agriculture expenditure will move away from subsidy payments linked to specific produce, toward direct payments based on farm size.

However, without the proper context of an OPEN public debate, such parody of sacred beliefs often and historically falls upon deaf ears. As such, these types of arguments are dismissed out of hand as rude or ignorant.  This note is a commentary, take it for what it is ... but don't think for a second that Henderson was the first to use such an argument.  He just spoke up at the right time. Kudos.  [[Special:Contributions/70.15.11.44|70.15.11.44]] ([[User talk:70.15.11.44|talk]]) 13:19, 17 April 2011 (UTC)<br />\n<br />\n*The editor above and I disagree about this edit: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flying_Spaghetti_Monster&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=424520089&amp;oldid=424166053], with the other editor making the argument above and in the edit summary (also at my talk page), and me arguing that we have sourcing for Bobby Henderson as the original proponent of the FSM, so that no citation-needed tag is necessary [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flying_Spaghetti_Monster&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=425408076&amp;oldid=425397747], and that, while there certainly have been other parody religions in the past, that is not the relevant point. This page is not an article about parody religions in general. Rather, it is about this particular phenomenon, the FSM specifically. As such, Henderson first described the FSM, and the fact that there were other, earlier parodies does not change that fact. It is incorrect to say that anyone before Henderson &quot;created&quot; the FSM, or that Henderson merely &quot;brought to public attention&quot; an FSM that previously existed, and it is equally incorrect to say that the FSM was &quot;originally&quot; intended as anything other than a protest against the Kansas board decision. What do other editors think? --[[User:Tryptofish|Tryptofish]] ([[User talk:Tryptofish|talk]]) 19:54, 23 April 2011 (UTC)<br />\n:* That might appear as [[Philosophic burden of proof|philosophical disagreement]] though I would think that we're speaking about concrete parody in this article and while ideas do float around, we'd need a concrete citation for prior usage of this specific parody, i.e. ''Flying Spaghetti Monster'',  to cast a doubt, and not the other way around. [[User:AgadaUrbanit|AgadaUrbanit]] ([[User talk:AgadaUrbanit|talk]]) 20:20, 23 April 2011 (UTC)<br />\n<br />\nIt was a plain and simple edit to make the statement ambiguous, in an attempt to avoid this type of debate. Perhaps it would've been more &quot;persuasive&quot;([[User_talk:Tryptofish#Flying_Spaghetti_Monster|Tryptofish]]) to not give my reasoning at all? ... If that's your methodology. Given that I do not have a citation at the ready to contradict your interpretation of just what happened I'll point you to the closest confirmation I could find.  [http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=flying+spaghetti+monster] Compare the ''earliest'' definition &quot;first publicly postulated&quot; (Aug 2, 2005), to the second earliest &quot;created&quot; (Aug 18, 2005).

I think we are getting close to consensus that there would have to be reliable sourcing to justify the claim that previous religious parodies were actually about the FSM specifically. If all the IP editor can do is make snarky remarks at me and cherry-pick quotes from the Urban Dictionary, perhaps it is time to bid farewell to that unsourced claim. --[[User:Tryptofish|Tryptofish]] ([[User talk:Tryptofish|talk]]) 18:30, 24 April 2011 (UTC)<br />\n*Sorry, but what are we arguing about here? With all due respect to the IP editor, why make the statement ambiguous when it is clearly attested by, for example, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A18740559#back3 the ''BBC h2g2'' article] or [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/27/AR2005082700019.html?nav=most_emailed this ''Washington Post'' article]. Even if ''&quot;it and its kin have been part of casual academic argument for much longer&quot;'', Henderson is the person who created the ''unique'' concept of the FSM; although similar to the idea of [[Russell's teapot]] or the [[Invisible Pink Unicorn]] it is neither of these, which are both lacking in noodly appendages. [[User:Captain Screebo|Captain Screebo]] ([[User talk:Captain Screebo|talk]]) 12:48, 25 April 2011 (UTC)<br />\n<br />\nDoes it state unequivocally that ORIGINAL intent for the argument of FSM was to target the KSSB?  Omitting this word (&quot;originally&quot; in reference to Henderson's intent) is a simple concession to reason.  The intent is still being stated.  And the meaning is only just tweaked, so as to remove the presumption of knowledge unknown without verification.  If left in, it either requires specific citation to the impetus of the &quot;FSM&quot; (conceding the historical record of Henderson as credited creator) being created for the KSSB letter, or it is original research.  Though I personally will still go on record in stating that FLYING SPAGHETTI MONSTER was around (by that exact name) ''years'' if not decades before 2005.

As LtPowers rightly says, the deities that Jenova20 states above also have their own articles, so this is more a discussion about whether this article should be titled FSM or Pastafarianism (or, I guess, have both as separate articles, though I am not backing that). See below for why I think the change would make sense. As for recongnisability of terms, FSM is much more recongnisable than Pastafarianism, I agree. But they are not synonyms; one describes the movement (or religion), one describes the deity. The movement encompasses the deity, so an article titled according to the movement rather than the deity makes more sense to me (if it is a choice between the two). [[User:Gorton k|Gorton k]] ([[User talk:Gorton k|talk]]) 16:09, 14 July 2011 (UTC)<br />\n::Normally, I'd agree, if this were a &quot;real&quot; religion.  In this case, however, &quot;Pastafarianism&quot; is just the word that was coined to describe &quot;worship&quot; of the FSM; the FSM is the important figure and the originating concept.

The article would flow better and encompass more if the focus were on the religious movement rather than the deity of the movement. Thinking in venn diagrams, Pastafarianism would completely cover the FSM, but the FSM does not completely cover Pastafarianism. It makes more sense to me to have an article which is already on the entire movement to be titled appropriately.

But I respectfully disagree with the other edits, and am about to revert them per [[WP:BRD]]. Removing the sub-headers in the holiday section simply makes for more continuous text, and does nothing to help our readers. And changing &quot;Beliefs&quot; to &quot;Purported beliefs&quot;, well, that really requires discussion before we make a change like that. Editing this page (which is, after all, a GA) involves running interference between those who are offended by the perceived insult to religion (please don't get me wrong: I'm not saying that of Chris), and those like the many above in this talk who are shocked, just shocked, that Wikipedia treats their &quot;religion&quot; as a &quot;parody religion&quot;. Yes, of course it's humorous. But about that &quot;tone&quot; tag, are we ''really'' going to have to explain to our readers that, no, these holidays are not really holidays? Give me a break! Actually, I've argued before for more extensive use of scare quotes (as in &quot;beliefs&quot;, etc.), and I'd be fine with revisiting that. But putting &quot;Purported&quot; in there? Please see [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (words to watch)]]. --[[User:Tryptofish|Tryptofish]] ([[User talk:Tryptofish|talk]]) 18:37, 17 July 2011 (UTC)<br />\n<br />\n: Unfortunately, yes we do. There are plenty of well-meaning editors who want to turn this article into a direct portrayal of &quot;pastafarianism&quot; as an actual religion, and if we don't ensure that every section of the article treats it as a parody uniformly then the beliefs section will be a cruft magnet. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flying_Spaghetti_Monster&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=440061613&amp;oldid=439987627 This], for example, is absolutely inappropriate for that reason. The &quot;beliefs&quot; are &quot;purported&quot; because ''nobody believes them''. The holidays section was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flying_Spaghetti_Monster&amp;oldid=336145162 part of the beliefs section when the article passed GA], and still belongs there because ''these aren't realy holidays''; they are simply part of the fake &quot;belief system&quot;, and were only moved out a few months ago in [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flying_Spaghetti_Monster&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=421030408&amp;oldid=420720724 this series of edits] (which are that editor's only WP contributions). That should have been undone at the time, as it lends totally undue weight to a minor part of the joke.<br />\n: So, yeah. The holidays section belongs back under the beliefs section with the headers removed. I personally feel that in order to discourage cruft we should make it plain that these are fake in the header, but if you want a compromise, how about &quot;belief system&quot; for that section's title? The holidays section still needs to be checked for tone and to make sure we're not making too big a deal of any particular fake holiday (such as, like, all three of the latter ones), but losing the headers and putting it back where it belongs is probably alright now that people are at least aware of the problem.

On the other hand, I'll say to LK that I can see Chris' view, in that it's a little too self-serious to refer to Pastafarians as a &quot;community&quot;. As I already said above, I'm in favor of making more extensive use of scare quotes, so I'd be fine with calling the section headers &quot;Beliefs&quot; and &quot;Holidays&quot;, with the quote marks as part of the headers, and I'd be fine with using more quotes in the text as well. As for the tone tag itself, I'll note that I didn't revert it (just corrected it with a &quot;section&quot; parameter), and I'm receptive to making some edits for tone. --[[User:Tryptofish|Tryptofish]] ([[User talk:Tryptofish|talk]]) 19:27, 18 July 2011 (UTC)<br />\n<br />\n::::: The article is not actually supposed to document the customs of &quot;the Pastafarian community&quot;. Said community is only actually notable for its various stunts resulting in a real-world event concerning religious tolerance, for instance the original ID letter, or the colander passport photo incident. As far as I'm concerned, the parts of the article covered by references 24 through 42 of the current revision should be pruned back to only what secondary sources consider noteworthy. For the time being, though, the way forward would be to reinstate the re-headering, though the header title can be left at Beliefs for now.

This page is not an article about parody religions in general. Rather, it is about this particular phenomenon, the FSM specifically.

It is incorrect to say that anyone before Henderson &quot;created&quot; the FSM, or that Henderson merely &quot;brought to public attention&quot; an FSM that previously existed, and it is equally incorrect to say that the FSM was &quot;originally&quot; intended as anything other than a protest against the Kansas board decision.

As LtPowers rightly says, the deities that Jenova20 states above also have their own articles, so this is more a discussion about whether this article should be titled FSM or Pastafarianism (or, I guess, have both as separate articles, though I am not backing that). See below for why I think the change would make sense. As for recongnisability of terms, FSM is much more recongnisable than Pastafarianism, I agree. But they are not synonyms; one describes the movement (or religion), one describes the deity. The movement encompasses the deity, so an article titled according to the movement rather than the deity makes more sense to me (if it is a choice between the two). [[User:Gorton k|Gorton k]] ([[User talk:Gorton k|talk]]) 16:09, 14 July 2011 (UTC)<br />\n::Normally, I'd agree, if this were a &quot;real&quot; religion.  In this case, however, &quot;Pastafarianism&quot; is just the word that was coined to describe &quot;worship&quot; of the FSM; the FSM is the important figure and the originating concept.

The article would flow better and encompass more if the focus were on the religious movement rather than the deity of the movement. Thinking in venn diagrams, Pastafarianism would completely cover the FSM, but the FSM does not completely cover Pastafarianism. It makes more sense to me to have an article which is already on the entire movement to be titled appropriately.

But it turns out that Omnianism is a construct of Terry Pratchett designed to highlight the potential tyrannies of the Church, rather than an actual religion, and as such we do not slavishly document its made-up customs as if they were real things (even if some people get carried away with the joke and actually carry them out. Hell, even if there were a ''Web forum'' for these people).

But I respectfully disagree with the other edits, and am about to revert them per [[WP:BRD]]. Removing the sub-headers in the holiday section simply makes for more continuous text, and does nothing to help our readers. And changing &quot;Beliefs&quot; to &quot;Purported beliefs&quot;, well, that really requires discussion before we make a change like that. Editing this page (which is, after all, a GA) involves running interference between those who are offended by the perceived insult to religion (please don't get me wrong: I'm not saying that of Chris), and those like the many above in this talk who are shocked, just shocked, that Wikipedia treats their &quot;religion&quot; as a &quot;parody religion&quot;. Yes, of course it's humorous. But about that &quot;tone&quot; tag, are we ''really'' going to have to explain to our readers that, no, these holidays are not really holidays? Give me a break! Actually, I've argued before for more extensive use of scare quotes (as in &quot;beliefs&quot;, etc.), and I'd be fine with revisiting that. But putting &quot;Purported&quot; in there? Please see [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (words to watch)]]. --[[User:Tryptofish|Tryptofish]] ([[User talk:Tryptofish|talk]]) 18:37, 17 July 2011 (UTC)<br />\n<br />\n: Unfortunately, yes we do. There are plenty of well-meaning editors who want to turn this article into a direct portrayal of &quot;pastafarianism&quot; as an actual religion, and if we don't ensure that every section of the article treats it as a parody uniformly then the beliefs section will be a cruft magnet. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flying_Spaghetti_Monster&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=440061613&amp;oldid=439987627 This], for example, is absolutely inappropriate for that reason. The &quot;beliefs&quot; are &quot;purported&quot; because ''nobody believes them''. The holidays section was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flying_Spaghetti_Monster&amp;oldid=336145162 part of the beliefs section when the article passed GA], and still belongs there because ''these aren't realy holidays''; they are simply part of the fake &quot;belief system&quot;, and were only moved out a few months ago in [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flying_Spaghetti_Monster&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=421030408&amp;oldid=420720724 this series of edits] (which are that editor's only WP contributions). That should have been undone at the time, as it lends totally undue weight to a minor part of the joke.<br />\n: So, yeah. The holidays section belongs back under the beliefs section with the headers removed. I personally feel that in order to discourage cruft we should make it plain that these are fake in the header, but if you want a compromise, how about &quot;belief system&quot; for that section's title? The holidays section still needs to be checked for tone and to make sure we're not making too big a deal of any particular fake holiday (such as, like, all three of the latter ones), but losing the headers and putting it back where it belongs is probably alright now that people are at least aware of the problem.

On the other hand, I'll say to LK that I can see Chris' view, in that it's a little too self-serious to refer to Pastafarians as a &quot;community&quot;. As I already said above, I'm in favor of making more extensive use of scare quotes, so I'd be fine with calling the section headers &quot;Beliefs&quot; and &quot;Holidays&quot;, with the quote marks as part of the headers, and I'd be fine with using more quotes in the text as well. As for the tone tag itself, I'll note that I didn't revert it (just corrected it with a &quot;section&quot; parameter), and I'm receptive to making some edits for tone. --[[User:Tryptofish|Tryptofish]] ([[User talk:Tryptofish|talk]]) 19:27, 18 July 2011 (UTC)<br />\n<br />\n::::: The article is not actually supposed to document the customs of &quot;the Pastafarian community&quot;. Said community is only actually notable for its various stunts resulting in a real-world event concerning religious tolerance, for instance the original ID letter, or the colander passport photo incident. As far as I'm concerned, the parts of the article covered by references 24 through 42 of the current revision should be pruned back to only what secondary sources consider noteworthy. For the time being, though, the way forward would be to reinstate the re-headering, though the header title can be left at Beliefs for now.

In recent years due to time constraints on our executive committee and support team, we have found it difficult to keep up with the work that Bur.st requires, and the gap between donation levels and our costs has grown.<br />\n<br />\nWe expect Bur.st will stop providing services to the public on 27 March 2012.

You recently deleted an article on Ryan M. Place from Detroit. Thank you for patrolling Wikipedia but i feel that Mr. Place is a notable person and worthy of being included, he's sort of a local legend in Michigan and nationally well-known in the film and writing communities. Mr. Place runs a film company, works for the Michigan Film Office, worked for DreamWorks on Transformers 3, he writes news articles as a freelance journalist, etc. I made the Ryan M. Place wiki page and cited reliable, independent sources and his prolific contributions to film and writing. Could you please un-delete his page or let me know what else is needed to qualify him?

The B series motor is a 4-cylinder diesel, and the H series a 6-cylinder diesel.  The diesel-engined trucks were never sold to the general public in the USA, though some found their way in as mine trucks.  The engines are similar, within the series.  For example, the F and 2F engines share many of the same parts. However the H and 2H engines have almost nothing in common.  There are individual models within the engine series, for example, there is an F125 engine, and an F155 engine, all in the F series with different power ratings.  Here is a list of some of them (the power and torque figures may vary depending on the market):<br />\n<br />\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;<br />\n|+ '''Petrol'''<br />\n!

With a folding windshield this allowed for complete open-air experience.<br />\n*The J40 Series also featured folding jump seats behind the passenger and drivers seats.  These folding seats not only made carrying another 2 passengers possible, but also allowed for maximum cargo space, as opposed to the folding rear seat in the Jeep CJ series.<br />\n*Original factory winches were driven directly from the transfer case (known as P.T.O. or [[power take off]]) powered by the engine. Later models had an optional electric [[winch]].<br />\n<br />\n==Future==<br />\nThere is a good sized following of people that collect, maintain, and drive their J-series truck off road.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}  {{Update after|2010|11|13}} Toyota still offers many replacement parts, {{Update after|2010|11|13}} available through Toyota parts departments worldwide.  Many of these trucks find their home in places with severe road conditions as work trucks, where they are used daily by their owners.  Its essence lives on in the [[Toyota Land Cruiser 70 Series|J70]] series, which is essentially a J40 with an updated front half and slightly different engine offerings, such as a turbo charged diesel. It sells in many countries, but was never for sale in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automoblog.net/2009/10/07/the-infamous-toyota-fj40/|title=The Infamous Toyota FJ40|publisher=Automoblog.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Toyota FJ Cruiser.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Toyota FJ Cruiser]] For 2006, Toyota introduced the [[Toyota FJ Cruiser|FJ Cruiser]], a modern SUV styled after the original FJ40. The FJ Cruiser (FJC) went on sale in the spring of 2006.<br />\n<br />\nEven though its production ended in Brazil many years ago, the Toyota Bandeirante is still very sought after, due to its good off-road performance. Thus Bandeirantes reach high prices in the Brazilian used car market, especially the rare 1993 models which were the only ones fitted with a Mercedes-Benz engine married to a five-speed transmission.<br />\n<br />\n==References==<br />\n{{Reflist}}<br />\n<br />\n==Further reading==<br />\n*{{cite book|last=Boltrek|first=Josh|title=The History of the Toyota Land Cruiser}}<br />\n<br />\n{{toyota}}<br />\n<br />\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Toyota Land Cruiser 40}}<br />\n[[Category:Toyota Land Cruiser|40]]<br />\n[[Category:All-wheel-drive vehicles]]<br />\n[[Category:SUVs]]<br />\n<br />\n[[de:Toyota Bandeirante]]<br />\n[[fa:تویوتا اف‌جی۴۰]]<br />\n[[pt:Toyota Bandeirante]]<br />\n[[fi:Toyota Bandeirante]]</div>",

For this comparison grid to be useful to readers, I propose that it be allowed to be comprehensive.  That means it might list &quot;less notable&quot; backup providers.  First, it is a matter of opinion who the most notable providers are.  And besides, less notable providers often offer unique distinguishing features in order to try and compete with the big guys. Not all of these second tier providers really need (or even merit) a specific Wikipedia page.  Which means linking directly to their website as the source of information.  For a comparison grid, the vendor website is in fact the authoritative reference or source for information. [[User:Brycen|BryceN]] ([[User talk:Brycen|talk]]) 21:14, 21 April 2009 (UTC)<br />\n<br />\nPlus, providers will as a mater of practice come to this page and add their own services.  I think it impractical to police that, and harmful to do so.  While there have been many removals of providers from this list in the past, I propose removals stop.  Your thoughts?

Since the first line in this list is &quot;This is a list of notable online backup services...&quot; doesn't it stand to reason that this statement means that the listed services are notable by Wikipedia standards?  Why is there some sense of urgency to include this item in the list just for the sake of having another service listed that doesn't link to an informative article on the subject?  Why not wait until there is an article on the subject to include it?  Including this item, supported by marginal coverage in a reliable source (isn't it really just a review), opens the door for argument for including any other service that has ever had a mention in a newspaper.  How does this increase the value of the list?  This is not notability by Wikipedia standards.

At the moment there is a strong inconsistency between the content and title of this article.  Editors should consider to rename the article to ''List_of_notable_online_backup_services''. However, it remains questionable what exactly a notable online backup services is (and whether such a distinction is meaningful in the first place for a ''list''). For instance, www.sugarsync.com appears to be notable through its website presence.

Please only add subjects that have a Wikipedia article or evidence of notability.&quot;  The statement at the top of the article reaffirms that &quot;This is a list of notable online backup services&quot;.  If we did not use the basic Wikipedia notability criteria, existence of an article, we would end up with an indiscriminate collection of information, which Wikipedia is [[WP:NOT|not]].  -- &lt;font color=&quot;#000080&quot;&gt;Mufka&lt;/font&gt; [[User:Mufka|&lt;sup&gt;(u)&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[User talk:Mufka|&lt;sup&gt;(t)&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/Mufka|&lt;sup&gt;(c)&lt;/sup&gt;]] 10:27, 25 August 2009 (UTC)<br />\n<br />\n:: Yes, that appears be exactly the issue here. A banner on the top does not make it automatically true and therefore notable! Looking at the articles that feature in this list, I find it difficult to see how these services are particularly &quot;notable&quot; in the public domain. All they have is a website and the occasional mentioning in some &quot;PC magazines&quot;. (confer: google or amazon) An own article in wikipedia does not automatically mean that the subject is of good notability. A normal list exactly servers the purpose of collecting information, without ending up with an indiscriminate array of data.

The banners do not confer notability, they state that items ''should'' be notable prior to being added to the list.  My concern is that if we have a list of redlinks, we are not providing value to the reader.  If it's supposed to be a list of notable items, they should meet a minimum notability litmus test, being the subject of an article.  -- &lt;font color=&quot;#000080&quot;&gt;Mufka&lt;/font&gt; [[User:Mufka|&lt;sup&gt;(u)&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[User talk:Mufka|&lt;sup&gt;(t)&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/Mufka|&lt;sup&gt;(c)&lt;/sup&gt;]] 10:52, 25 August 2009 (UTC)<br />\n:::: Yes, I agree that an entry in Wikipedia means that  community has deemed it notable. However, there is a problem with this argument: that is if there NO Wikipedia article (yet) that the subject is NOT notable.

When i am curious about writing an article on a new subject, i routinely search for the term here on WP, and find each use that is related to my understanding of it, then i redlink them with edit summary &quot;redlink for future article&quot;. i then make a note to myself to one day write the article. if i dont find any use on WP of the term except in lists, i would remove the term from any stand alone lists. if i find lots of uses here, then its a surefire article that hasnt been written yet, and i would leave it in a stand alone list with some info on notabiility, if nothing else a piped link to an article than mentions it. for sugarsync, im inclined to include it in the table, with a piped link to the company, but i would also try to improve that article. What i like is when i see only a few redlinks, where there is some effort to show notability so i can go &quot;oh, yes, that deserves an article, i hope someone will write it soon&quot; rather than &quot;what the hell is this? is this just promotional, or was it added by someone who doesnt understand notability?&quot; too many redlinks could mean its an indiscriminate list. of course, sheer numbers arent the only guide, but its a good indicator that a list needs attention. and i prefer to not use the word &quot;notable&quot; as thats too often just shorthand for WP inclusion guidelines, and we dont want self reference. more of a style point to me. the word does of course fit.[[User:Mercurywoodrose|Mercurywoodrose]] ([[User talk:Mercurywoodrose|talk]]) 18:55, 4 September 2009 (UTC)<br />\n<br />\n==The use of &quot;Stand-alone_list&quot; for this article==<br />\nThe community has currently [[Wikipedia:Stand-alone_list|agreed]] to use Stand alone lists to link wikipedia &quot;articles that primarily consist of a list or a group of lists, linking to articles or lists in a particular subject area, such as a timeline of events or people and places&quot;.

Also the section [[Wikipedia:Stand-alone_list#Lists_of_people| on list of people]] make it clear that a criteria of notability should be used for inclusion.

Rather than getting into a notability argument for every service that might be added to the list, why not fall back on the existing system for establishing notability.  A service can't have an article unless it is notable.  If it has an article, we don't even have to have a discussion.  If an article is written about a service that might be borderline, we have systems for getting community consensus on notability.  Why drag those discussions out of where they belong and into this forum?  -- &lt;font color=&quot;#000080&quot;&gt;Mufka&lt;/font&gt; [[User:Mufka|&lt;sup&gt;(u)&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[User talk:Mufka|&lt;sup&gt;(t)&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/Mufka|&lt;sup&gt;(c)&lt;/sup&gt;]] 18:43, 3 September 2009 (UTC)<br />\n:::: Yes, I guess, you  could have an entry once you get your service up running properly. (I don't know how long it takes to become notable with this kind of service and whether this can be done in two weeks.) The problem with your argument is that you take wikipedia as the yard stick for the (outside) world, rather than the world as the yard stick for wikipedia. Wikipedia is trying to be about the world and the people and things encountered there. When the community decides whether an article can enter wikipedia, it tries to estimate whether people ''outside wikipedia in general'' think so and not whether inside this forum somebody thinks so in isolation to outside. In other words, a reference to a good article is nothing else but a reference to the outside world. That's why we value references. One thing for sure, if a proper article exists, notability can mostly be assumed as you rightly suggest. Yet, it cannot be the other way around, if there is no entry, you cannot assume there is no notability. Ironically, the entry in question, has about 10 times more hits on google than some other entries in the list that I probed. So once you get your service up and running and write a nice article about it, it would be in... On a serious note, my point is: because someone has not bothered to write a fully-fledged article, but makes a start to add it to a ''list'', I cannot see how the quality of this encyclopedia is endangered. On the contrary, I believe the currently practised exclusion of this one service on the grounds of not having an wikipedia entry is a form of '''extreme exlusionism'''. It jeopardises the very point of a ''list'' to give an overview, neither ending up with an array of stubs, or with nothing. Not following this practice, would allow a high degree of quality while still being rather inclusive: a moderate position.  [[User:Mootros|Mootros]] ([[User talk:Mootros|talk]]) 21:41, 3 September 2009 (UTC)<br />\n:::::Again, I think you are misinformed about what governs what is notable in the context of Wikipedia.  Notability is a purely Wikipedia judgment and it is determined by the community and codified in Wikipedia policy.  It seems that the concept of using the existence of an article as criteria for a list is new to you.  This is very widely used.  We are not making lists of things that are of note to the world.  We are making lists of things that are notable by Wikipedia's definition.  Making a list of &quot;things&quot; whose existence is justified only by some link to an external web site, diminishes the value of Wikipedia in general because we're sending viewers soemwhere else to view content rather than satisfying them internally.

In essence: entries should be notable, and the presence of a Wikipedia article is a useful shortcut to checking that, but it is not itself the metric.

Earlier denoted as ref K and explained as encryption against all parties other than the user itself (including provider) does not stand. When the data is truly private, provider cannot know what is stored and if the user's key is lost, cannot recover the data. Encryption during transfer and while stored helps against third parties but does not guarantee privacy as the provider can unlock the data whenever it wants if they have the key. I suggest a column for privacy although I do not have time to populate it with data. Easiest way to find that out might be to ask the provider if they are able to recover the data when the key is lost.

Whether or not it uses a secure transfer protocol (such as [[SSL]]) is an entirely different matter. The two cannot and should not be confused or combined. I think in most cases it can be assumed that some kind of [[TLS]] is used so that is probably not note worthy. --[[User:Hm2k|Hm2k]] ([[User talk:Hm2k|talk]]) 21:53, 14 July 2010 (UTC)<br />\n<br />\nSeems to me that as long as the privacy is provided through encryption, this column can still easily serve that purpose, and seems to be doing so now (probably more legibly than by adding another column). What is needed, though, is an expanded &quot;Legend&quot; for footnote &quot;2 Encryption&quot;. Currently, it indicates that a &quot;Yes&quot; in that column means only that a service encrypts data in storage and transport; however, the column has entries saying &quot;Partial; transmission and storage only&quot;--suggesting that at least one more factor is needed for an unqualified &quot;Yes&quot;. So, the Encryption column's footnote needs to name and describe that other factor, and if it's privacy, then some explanation is needed. Perhaps the revised footnote might read, &quot;Encryption - Data encryption applies to all data during transport and storage, and data privacy is ensured because the service provider does not have the key to decrypt the data.&quot; --[[User:Rich Janis|Rich Janis]] ([[User talk:Rich Janis|talk]]) 10:52, 15 November 2011 (UTC)<br />\n<br />\n:{{Agree}} I also agree for the &quot;Privacy&quot; column that means that the storage provider does not have access to your data.

At all.  There's no backup of exchange stores, no classic SMB share support, no SQL backups, doesn't back up ESXi stores, doesn't do registries, has zero facilitation for ActiveDirectory backups, no bare-metal options, and in fact I can't see where it actually does anything &quot;backup&quot; related outside of Word revision tracking. If you burn your building down, you will NOT be using this service to rebuild your racks. It's exactly a &quot;document sharing service&quot;, which is NOT an &quot;online backup&quot;.  Calling this a &quot;backup&quot; is like calling sharepoint a &quot;backup&quot;, or SVN a &quot;backup&quot;, or dropbox a &quot;backup&quot;.  They are no such things by any enterprise standard; they are collaboration services being shoe-horned into this list.<br />\n<br />\nI suspect there's a need for a definition of what constitutes a &quot;backup service&quot;.  Real-time replication of data that just got corrupted by an attacker probably does not meet that definition, nor does an external hard disk that you manually drag-n-drop into, nor does a few other entries in this list. Otherwise, I can include Wikipedia itself in this list, since I can copy/paste a few TB of of base64 crap into various talk and chatter pages, and call that my &quot;backup&quot;. And it even meets notability requirements, since WP has an article on itself and mentions it being a repository.  I'll suggest that there's a difference between &quot;can be mis-used as in one single special case&quot; and &quot;is&quot;.  It's a bit of a quagmire, but collaboration tools are not backups.  I might suggest two tests to begin:  1. Will provide 100% recovery when building burns down, and 2. Will provide 100% recovery when attacker deliberately destroys data.  If a backup solution cannot deliver those two things, it's rather dishonest to claim it's a backup.  Thru, dropbox, and even DoubleTake, for example, all fail this pair of tests that are quite likely the general case.

For this comparison grid to be useful to readers, I propose that it be allowed to be comprehensive.  That means it might list &quot;less notable&quot; backup providers.  First, it is a matter of opinion who the most notable providers are.  And besides, less notable providers often offer unique distinguishing features in order to try and compete with the big guys. Not all of these second tier providers really need (or even merit) a specific Wikipedia page.  Which means linking directly to their website as the source of information.  For a comparison grid, the vendor website is in fact the authoritative reference or source for information.

Why is there some sense of urgency to include this item in the list just for the sake of having another service listed that doesn't link to an informative article on the subject?  Why not wait until there is an article on the subject to include it?  Including this item, supported by marginal coverage in a reliable source (isn't it really just a review), opens the door for argument for including any other service that has ever had a mention in a newspaper.

All they have is a website and the occasional mentioning in some &quot;PC magazines&quot;.

What i like is when i see only a few redlinks, where there is some effort to show notability so i can go &quot;oh, yes, that deserves an article, i hope someone will write it soon&quot; rather than &quot;what the hell is this? is this just promotional, or was it added by someone who doesnt understand notability?&quot; too many redlinks could mean its an indiscriminate list. of course, sheer numbers arent the only guide, but its a good indicator that a list needs attention. and i prefer to not use the word &quot;notable&quot; as thats too often just shorthand for WP inclusion guidelines, and we dont want self reference. more of a style point to me. the word does of course fit.[[User:Mercurywoodrose|Mercurywoodrose]] ([[User talk:Mercurywoodrose|talk]]) 18:55, 4 September 2009 (UTC)<br />\n<br />\n==The use of &quot;Stand-alone_list&quot; for this article==<br />\nThe community has currently [[Wikipedia:Stand-alone_list|agreed]] to use Stand alone lists to link wikipedia &quot;articles that primarily consist of a list or a group of lists, linking to articles or lists in a particular subject area, such as a timeline of events or people and places&quot;. The above discussions now raise the point whether online backup services does constitute a &quot;subject area&quot; (such as a timeline of events or people and places). Also the section [[Wikipedia:Stand-alone_list#Lists_of_people| on list of people]] make it clear that a criteria of notability should be used for inclusion. So if this would be applied to this list as a &quot;list of things&quot;, it raises the question what is a notable online backup services.

Rather than getting into a notability argument for every service that might be added to the list, why not fall back on the existing system for establishing notability.  A service can't have an article unless it is notable.  If it has an article, we don't even have to have a discussion.  If an article is written about a service that might be borderline, we have systems for getting community consensus on notability.  Why drag those discussions out of where they belong and into this forum?  -- &lt;font color=&quot;#000080&quot;&gt;Mufka&lt;/font&gt; [[User:Mufka|&lt;sup&gt;(u)&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[User talk:Mufka|&lt;sup&gt;(t)&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/Mufka|&lt;sup&gt;(c)&lt;/sup&gt;]] 18:43, 3 September 2009 (UTC)<br />\n:::: Yes, I guess, you  could have an entry once you get your service up running properly. (I don't know how long it takes to become notable with this kind of service and whether this can be done in two weeks.) The problem with your argument is that you take wikipedia as the yard stick for the (outside) world, rather than the world as the yard stick for wikipedia. Wikipedia is trying to be about the world and the people and things encountered there. When the community decides whether an article can enter wikipedia, it tries to estimate whether people ''outside wikipedia in general'' think so and not whether inside this forum somebody thinks so in isolation to outside. In other words, a reference to a good article is nothing else but a reference to the outside world. That's why we value references. One thing for sure, if a proper article exists, notability can mostly be assumed as you rightly suggest. Yet, it cannot be the other way around, if there is no entry, you cannot assume there is no notability. Ironically, the entry in question, has about 10 times more hits on google than some other entries in the list that I probed. So once you get your service up and running and write a nice article about it, it would be in... On a serious note, my point is: because someone has not bothered to write a fully-fledged article, but makes a start to add it to a ''list'', I cannot see how the quality of this encyclopedia is endangered. On the contrary, I believe the currently practised exclusion of this one service on the grounds of not having an wikipedia entry is a form of '''extreme exlusionism'''. It jeopardises the very point of a ''list'' to give an overview, neither ending up with an array of stubs, or with nothing. Not following this practice, would allow a high degree of quality while still being rather inclusive: a moderate position.  [[User:Mootros|Mootros]] ([[User talk:Mootros|talk]]) 21:41, 3 September 2009 (UTC)<br />\n:::::Again, I think you are misinformed about what governs what is notable in the context of Wikipedia.  Notability is a purely Wikipedia judgment and it is determined by the community and codified in Wikipedia policy.  It seems that the concept of using the existence of an article as criteria for a list is new to you.  This is very widely used.  We are not making lists of things that are of note to the world.  We are making lists of things that are notable by Wikipedia's definition.  Making a list of &quot;things&quot; whose existence is justified only by some link to an external web site, diminishes the value of Wikipedia in general because we're sending viewers soemwhere else to view content rather than satisfying them internally.

To prove notability, per [[WP:N]], significant coverage in multiple reliable sources is required. This can either be established by putting citations next to the entry in the list of by the entry having a Wikipedia article (where it is presumed notability is demonstrated thereon by the same sort of citations; if not, the article can be taken to AfD). In essence: entries should be notable, and the presence of a Wikipedia article is a useful shortcut to checking that, but it is not itself the metric. That said, if an entry in the list is truly notable, why shouldn't it have its own article? It would not be unreasonable to ask someone to make a stub before adding an entry to the list. --[[User:Cybercobra|&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;3773A5&quot;&gt;Cyber&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;FFB521&quot;&gt;cobra&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Cybercobra|(talk)]] 22:04, 11 September 2009 (UTC)<br />\n<br />\n:I agree with Cybercobra.

Earlier denoted as ref K and explained as encryption against all parties other than the user itself (including provider) does not stand. When the data is truly private, provider cannot know what is stored and if the user's key is lost, cannot recover the data. Encryption during transfer and while stored helps against third parties but does not guarantee privacy as the provider can unlock the data whenever it wants if they have the key. I suggest a column for privacy although I do not have time to populate it with data. Easiest way to find that out might be to ask the provider if they are able to recover the data when the key is lost.

Whether or not it uses a secure transfer protocol (such as [[SSL]]) is an entirely different matter. The two cannot and should not be confused or combined. I think in most cases it can be assumed that some kind of [[TLS]] is used so that is probably not note worthy. --[[User:Hm2k|Hm2k]] ([[User talk:Hm2k|talk]]) 21:53, 14 July 2010 (UTC)<br />\n<br />\nSeems to me that as long as the privacy is provided through encryption, this column can still easily serve that purpose, and seems to be doing so now (probably more legibly than by adding another column). What is needed, though, is an expanded &quot;Legend&quot; for footnote &quot;2 Encryption&quot;. Currently, it indicates that a &quot;Yes&quot; in that column means only that a service encrypts data in storage and transport; however, the column has entries saying &quot;Partial; transmission and storage only&quot;--suggesting that at least one more factor is needed for an unqualified &quot;Yes&quot;. So, the Encryption column's footnote needs to name and describe that other factor, and if it's privacy, then some explanation is needed. Perhaps the revised footnote might read, &quot;Encryption - Data encryption applies to all data during transport and storage, and data privacy is ensured because the service provider does not have the key to decrypt the data.&quot; --[[User:Rich Janis|Rich Janis]] ([[User talk:Rich Janis|talk]]) 10:52, 15 November 2011 (UTC)<br />\n<br />\n:{{Agree}} I also agree for the &quot;Privacy&quot; column that means that the storage provider does not have access to your data.

There is no pricing or any system requirements on their site. Also their sharing solution confusing with its title: &quot;Dropbox Enterprise File Transfer&quot;. --[[User:Dvvarf|Dvvarf]] ([[User talk:Dvvarf|talk]]) 10:40, 24 March 2012 (UTC)<br />\n<br />\nI don't see where Thru is a backup solution. At all.  There's no backup of exchange stores, no classic SMB share support, no SQL backups, doesn't back up ESXi stores, doesn't do registries, has zero facilitation for ActiveDirectory backups, no bare-metal options, and in fact I can't see where it actually does anything &quot;backup&quot; related outside of Word revision tracking. If you burn your building down, you will NOT be using this service to rebuild your racks. It's exactly a &quot;document sharing service&quot;, which is NOT an &quot;online backup&quot;.  Calling this a &quot;backup&quot; is like calling sharepoint a &quot;backup&quot;, or SVN a &quot;backup&quot;, or dropbox a &quot;backup&quot;.  They are no such things by any enterprise standard; they are collaboration services being shoe-horned into this list.<br />\n<br />\nI suspect there's a need for a definition of what constitutes a &quot;backup service&quot;.  Real-time replication of data that just got corrupted by an attacker probably does not meet that definition, nor does an external hard disk that you manually drag-n-drop into, nor does a few other entries in this list. Otherwise, I can include Wikipedia itself in this list, since I can copy/paste a few TB of of base64 crap into various talk and chatter pages, and call that my &quot;backup&quot;. And it even meets notability requirements, since WP has an article on itself and mentions it being a repository.  I'll suggest that there's a difference between &quot;can be mis-used as in one single special case&quot; and &quot;is&quot;.  It's a bit of a quagmire, but collaboration tools are not backups.  I might suggest two tests to begin:  1. Will provide 100% recovery when building burns down, and 2. Will provide 100% recovery when attacker deliberately destroys data.  If a backup solution cannot deliver those two things, it's rather dishonest to claim it's a backup.  Thru, dropbox, and even DoubleTake, for example, all fail this pair of tests that are quite likely the general case.

Often this person is lying on the ground with the entire back torso in full contact. This enables both the arms and legs to be &quot;bone-stacked&quot; for maximum stability and support of the Flyer. Main points of contact with the flyer are the feet (generally placed on the Flyer's hips, groin or lower abdomen) and the hands (which either form handholds or grasp the shoulders).<br />\n* '''Flyer''' - this is the individual who is elevated off the ground by the Base. The Flyer can move into a series of dynamic positions, and generally lets gravity do the work for them. A Flyer needs balance, confidence, and core strength.<br />\n* '''Spotter''' - this is the individual who has an objective view of the partners, and whose entire focus is on making sure that the Flyer lands safely in case of any slips. The spotter can also make recommendations to the Base and Flyer to improve their form.<br />\n<br />\n==Elements==<br />\n[[File:AcroYoga pose Back Bird variation.jpg|thumb|Acro Yoga Inverted Dancer pose.]]<br />\n'''Acrobatics''' is the physical part of Acroyoga that uses [[gymnastics]] techniques to build strength, flexibility, trust and teamwork between partners.  This is called ''Solar Acrobatic Practice'' by the California school.&lt;ref name=&quot;The AcroYoga Practice&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The AcroYoga Practice|url=http://www.acroyoga.org/about/the-acroyoga-practice|website=AcroYoga.org|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Front plank'' is a basic Acroyoga pose where one partner (''base'') supports the ''flying'' partner above them with their hands and feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Front Plank|url=http://acropedia.org/front-plank/|website=acropedia.org|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\n'''Yoga''' reflects the physical, mental, and spiritual disciplines of traditional [[Yoga]].

''AcroYoga Flight Manual'', 2008, acroyoga.org&lt;/ref&gt; Strength training is accomplished through repetition of exercises like [[push-up]]s and [[hand walking]]. [[Yin yoga|Flexibility training]] is best done at the end of a session with a partner. Learning good Acroyoga technique takes time and effort and is best learned with an expert teacher.&lt;ref name=&quot;flightmanual&quot; /&gt;  One important Acroyoga technique is called ''stacking the bones.'' This involves the base partner keeping arms and legs straight to maximize the weight load on bones rather than muscles to support the flyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FIVE REASONS YOU SHOULD DO ACROYOGA|url=http://www.pilgrimageyoga.com/five-reasons-you-should-do-acroyoga/|website=Pilgrimage of the Heart Yoga|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\n==Controversy==<br />\nIn late 2006, AcroYoga Inc. trademarked the word &quot;ACROYOGA&quot; asserting that the word's first use anywhere was in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AcroYoga|url=http://www.trademarkia.com/acroyoga-77066872.html|website=Legal Force Trademark Search|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the term had been used since 1999 by Jessie Goldberg and Eugene Poku&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://acroyoga.com/about-us|website=acroyogamontréal|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their domain, acroyoga.com had been registered since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Is Lookup|url=http://whois.net/whois/acroyoga.com|website=WhoIs.net|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By way of example only, and not as a limitation, &quot;AcroYoga&quot; and the AcroYoga logo are registered trademarks of AcroYoga, Inc., under the applicable laws of the United States and/or other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Copyright and Trademark Information|url=http://www.acroyoga.org/copyright|website=AcroYoga.org|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\n==Learning AcroYoga==<br />\n[[File:AcroYoga Jam.jpg|right|thumb|AcroYoga jam in a public park in Austin, Texas.]]<br />\nYoga studios may provide instructor led AcroYoga lessons.

Often this person is lying on the ground with the entire back torso in full contact. This enables both the arms and legs to be &quot;bone-stacked&quot; for maximum stability and support of the Flyer. Main points of contact with the flyer are the feet (generally placed on the Flyer's hips, groin or lower abdomen) and the hands (which either form handholds or grasp the shoulders).<br />\n* '''Flyer''' - this is the individual who is elevated off the ground by the Base. The Flyer can move into a series of dynamic positions, and generally lets gravity do the work for them. A Flyer needs balance, confidence, and core strength.<br />\n* '''Spotter''' - this is the individual who has an objective view of the partners, and whose entire focus is on making sure that the Flyer lands safely in case of any slips.

He/she is able to assume personal responsibility for the development and application of engineering science and knowledge, notably in research, design, construction, manufacturing, superintending, managing and in the education of the engineer. His/her work is predominantly intellectual and varied and not of a routine mental or physical character. It requires the exercise of original thought and judgement and the ability to supervise the technical and administrative work of others. His/her education will have been such as to make him/her capable of closely and continuously following progress in his/her branch of engineering science by consulting newly published works on a worldwide basis, assimilating such information and applying it independently. He/she is thus placed in a position to make contributions to the development of engineering science or its applications. His/her education and training will have been such that he/she will have acquired a broad and general appreciation of the engineering sciences as well as thorough insight into the special features of his/her own branch. In due time he/she will be able to give authoritative technical advice and to assume responsibility for the direction of important tasks in his/her branch. }}<br />\n<br />\n==Roles and expertise==<br />\n<br />\n===Design===<br />\nEngineers develop new technological solutions. During the [[engineering design process]], the responsibilities of the engineer may include defining problems, conducting and narrowing research, analyzing criteria, finding and analyzing solutions, and making decisions. Much of an engineer's time is spent on [[research]]ing, locating, applying, and transferring information.&lt;ref&gt;A. Eide, R. Jenison, L. Mashaw, L. Northup. Engineering: Fundamentals and Problem Solving. New York City: McGraw-Hill Companies Inc.,2002&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, research suggests engineers spend 56% of their time engaged in various information behaviours, including 14% actively searching for information.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson (2010) JASIST&quot;/&gt;<br />\n<br />\nEngineers must weigh different design choices on their merits and choose the solution that best matches the requirements. Their crucial and unique task is to identify, understand, and interpret the constraints on a design in order to produce a successful result.<br />\n<br />\n===Analysis===<br />\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-23805-1665, Ingenieure mit Konstruktionsplan.jpg|thumb|Engineers conferring on prototype design, 1954]]<br />\n<br />\nEngineers apply techniques of [[engineering analysis]] in testing, production, or maintenance. Analytical engineers may supervise production in factories and elsewhere, determine the causes of a process failure, and test output to maintain quality. They also estimate the [[time and motion study|time and cost required to complete projects]]. Supervisory engineers are responsible for major components or entire projects. Engineering analysis involves the application of scientific analytic principles and processes to reveal the properties and state of the system, device or mechanism under study.  Engineering analysis proceeds by separating the engineering design into the mechanisms of operation or failure, analyzing or estimating each component of the operation or failure mechanism in isolation, and recombining the components.

Civil engineering, for example, includes structural and transportation engineering and materials engineering include ceramic, metallurgical, and polymer engineering. Mechanical engineering cuts across just about every discipline since its core essence is [[applied physics]].  Engineers also may specialize in one industry, such as motor vehicles, or in one type of technology, such as turbines or semiconductor materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;bls&quot; /&gt;<br />\n<br />\nSeveral recent studies have investigated how engineers spend their time; that is, the work tasks they perform and how their time is distributed among these.

Amongst other more detailed findings, a recent [[work sampling]] study&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson (2012) DS&quot;/&gt; found that engineers spend 62.92% of their time engaged in technical work, 40.37% in social work, and 49.66% in computer-based work. Furthermore, there was considerable overlap between these different types of work, with engineers spending 24.96% of their time engaged in technical and social work, 37.97% in technical and non-social, 15.42% in non-technical and social, and 21.66% in non-technical and non-social.<br />\n<br />\nEngineering is also an information-intensive field, with research finding that engineers spend 55.8% of their time engaged in various different information behaviours, including 14.2% actively [[information seeking|seeking information]] from other people (7.8%) and information repositories such as documents and databases (6.4%).&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson (2010) JASIST&quot;/&gt;<br />\n<br />\nThe time engineers spend engaged in such activities is also reflected in the [[competence (human resources)|competencies]] required in engineering roles. In addition to engineers’ core technical competence, research has also demonstrated the critical nature of their personal attributes, project management skills, and cognitive abilities to success in the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = M.

Typically engineers will have deep knowledge in one area and basic knowledge in related areas. For example, mechanical engineering curricula typically includes introductory courses in electrical engineering, computer science, materials science, metallurgy, mathematics, and software engineering.<br />\n<br />\nWhen developing a product, engineers typically work in interdisciplinary teams. For example, when building [[robot]]s an engineering team will typically have at least three types of engineers. A mechanical engineer would design the body and actuators. An electrical engineer would design the power systems, sensors, and control circuitry. Finally, a software engineer would develop the software that makes the robot behave properly.  Engineers that aspire to management engage in further study in business administration, project management and organizational or business psychology.  Often engineers move up the management hierarchy from managing projects, functional departments, divisions and eventually CEO's of a multi-national corporation.  Management Engineers also work in [[management consulting]] firms in the area of [[strategic management]] of change in engineering-driven organizations.<br />\n<br />\n{| class=&quot;wikitable sortable&quot;<br />\n|-<br />\n!

Many [[engineering societies]] have established codes of practice and codes of ethics to guide members and inform the public at large. Each engineering discipline and professional society maintains a code of ethics, which the members pledge to uphold. Depending on their specializations, engineers may also be governed by specific statute, whistleblowing, product liability laws, and often the principles of [[business ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = American Society of Civil Engineers | authorlink = American Society of Civil Engineers | year = 2006 | title = Code of Ethics | publisher = ASCE Press | location = Reston, Virginia, USA | url = http://www.asce.org/Leadership-and-Management/Ethics/Code-of-Ethics/ | accessdate = 2011-06-11 | origyear = 1914 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Institution of Civil Engineers | authorlink= Institution of Civil Engineers | year = 2009 | title = Royal Charter, By-laws, Regulations and Rules | url = http://www.ice.org.uk/getattachment/c0b1371e-5179-49da-8e5f-62a6abe0b9fd/ICE-Royal-Charter,-By-laws,-Regulations-and-Rules.aspx | accessdate = 2011-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = National Society of Professional Engineers | authorlink = National Society of Professional Engineers | year = 2007 | title = Code of Ethics | publisher = NSPE | location = Alexandria, Virginia, USA | url = http://www.nspe.org/resources/pdfs/Ethics/CodeofEthics/Code-2007-July.pdf | accessdate = 2006-10-20 | origyear = 1964 }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Engg Ringing CU.jpg|thumb|left|An engineer receiving his [[Order of the Engineer]] ring|215x215px]]<br />\n<br />\nSome graduates of engineering programs in North America may be recognized by the [[Iron Ring]] or [[Engineer's Ring]], a ring made of iron or stainless steel that is worn on the little finger of the dominant hand. This tradition began in 1925 in Canada with [[The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer]], where the ring serves as a symbol and reminder of the engineer's obligations to the engineering profession. In 1972, the practice was adopted by several colleges in the United States including members of the [[Order of the Engineer]].<br />\n<br />\n==Education==<br />\n{{Main article|Engineering education}}<br />\n<br />\nMost engineering programs involve a concentration of study in an engineering specialty, along with courses in both mathematics and the physical and life sciences. Many programs also include courses in general engineering and applied accounting. A design course, often accompanied by a computer or laboratory class or both, is part of the curriculum of most programs. Often, general courses not directly related to engineering, such as those in the social sciences or humanities, also are required.<br />\n<br />\n[[Educational accreditation|Accreditation]] is the process by which engineering programs are evaluated by an external body to determine if applicable standards are met. The [[Washington Accord]] serves as an international accreditation agreement for academic engineering degrees, recognizing the substantial equivalency in the standards set by many major national engineering bodies. In the United States, post-secondary degree programs in engineering are accredited by the [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]].<br />\n<br />\n==Regulation==<br />\n{{Main article|Regulation and licensure in engineering}}<br />\nIn many countries, engineering tasks such as the design of bridges, electric power plants, industrial equipment, machine design and chemical plants, must be approved by a licensed professional engineer. Most commonly titled [[Professional Engineer]] is a license to practice and is indicated with the use of [[post-nominal letters]]; PE or P.Eng.  These are common in North America, as is European Engineer ([[European Engineer|EUR ING]]) in Europe. The practice of engineering in the UK is not a regulated profession but the control of the titles of [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|Chartered Engineer (CEng)]] and [[Engineering technologist#United Kingdom|Incorporated Engineer (IEng)]] is regulated. These titles are protected by law and are subject to strict requirements defined by the Engineering Council UK.  The title CEng is in use in much of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].<br />\n<br />\n&lt;!-- Commented out: [[Image:TacomaNarrowsBridgeCollapse in color.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Tacoma Narrows Bridge Collapse]] --&gt;<br />\nMany skilled / semi-skilled trades and [[engineering technician]]s in the UK call themselves engineers. A growing movement in the UK is to legally protect the title 'Engineer' so that only professional engineers can use it; a [[petition]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/6271|title=Make 'Engineer' a protected title - Petitions|work=Petitions - UK Government and Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt; was started to further this cause.<br />\n<br />\nIn the United States, licensure is generally attainable through combination of [[education]], pre-examination ([[Fundamentals of Engineering exam]]), examination (Professional Engineering Exam),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncees.org/] NCEES is a national nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing professional licensure for engineers and surveyors.&lt;/ref&gt; and engineering experience (typically in the area of 5+ years). Each state tests and licenses [[Professional Engineer]]s. Currently, most states do not license by specific engineering discipline, but rather provide generalized licensure, and trust engineers to use professional judgment regarding their individual competencies; this is the favoured approach of the professional societies. Despite this, however, at least one of the examinations required by most states is actually focused on a particular discipline; candidates for licensure typically choose the category of examination which comes closest to their respective expertise.<br />\n<br />\nIn Canada, engineering is a self regulated profession.  The profession in each province is governed by its own engineering association. For instance, in the Province of British Columbia an engineering graduate with four or more years of post graduate experience in an engineering-related field and passing exams in ethics and law will need to be registered by the Association for Professional Engineers and Geoscientists ([[APEGBC]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apeg.bc.ca/|title=APEGBC - Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of British Columbia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to become a Professional Engineer and be granted the professional designation of P.Eng allowing one to practice engineering.<br />\n<br />\nIn [[Continental Europe]], [[Latin America]], [[Turkey]] and elsewhere the title is limited by law to people with an engineering degree and the use of the title by others is illegal. In [[Italy]], the title is limited to people who both hold an engineering degree and have passed a professional qualification examination (''Esame di Stato''). In [[Portugal]], professional engineer titles and accredited engineering degrees are regulated and certified by the ''[[Ordem dos Engenheiros]]''. In the [[Czech Republic]], the title &quot;engineer&quot; (Ing.) is given to people with a (masters) degree in chemistry, technology or economics for historical and traditional reasons. In [[Greece]], the academic title of &quot;Diploma Engineer&quot; is awarded after completion of the five-year engineering study course and the title of &quot;Certified Engineer&quot; is awarded after completion of the four-year course of engineering studies at a Technological Educational Institute (TEI).<br />\n<br />\n==Perception==<br />\n{{Original research section|date=July 2014}}<br />\nThe perception and definition of the term 'engineer' varies across countries and continents.[[File:Brunel.jpg|thumb|right|19th century engineer [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] by the launching chains of the [[SS Great Eastern]]]]<br />\n<br />\n=== UK ===<br />\nBritish school children in the 1950s were brought up with stirring tales of &quot;the Victorian Engineers&quot;, chief amongst whom were [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel|Brunel]], [[George Stephenson|Stephenson]], [[Thomas Telford|Telford]], and their contemporaries. In the UK, &quot;engineering&quot; has more recently been styled as an industry sector consisting of employers and employees loosely termed &quot;engineers&quot; who included semi-skilled trades. However, the 21st-century view, especially amongst the more educated members of society, is to reserve the term Engineer to describe a university-educated practitioner of ingenuity represented by the Chartered (or Incorporated) Engineer qualifications.  However, a large proportion of the UK public still thinks of &quot;Engineers&quot; as skilled trades or even semi-skilled tradespeople with a high school education.  And UK skilled and semi-skilled trades style themselves as &quot;Engineers&quot;.  This has created confusion in the eyes of the public to understand what professional engineers actually do from fixing car engines, TV's, fridges to designing and managing the development of aircraft, space craft, power stations, infrastructure, and other complex technological systems.<br />\n<br />\n=== France ===<br />\nIn France, the term 'ingénieur&quot; (engineer) is not a protected title and can be used by anyone, even by those who do not possess an academic degree.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, the title &quot;Ingénieur Diplomé&quot; (Graduate Engineer) is an official academic title that is protected by the government and is associated with the &quot;[[Diplôme d'Ingénieur]]&quot;, which is one of the most prestigious academic degrees in France. Anyone misusing this title in France can be fined a large sum and jailed, as it is reserved for graduates of French engineering ''[[grandes écoles]]'' that provide highly intensive training in science and engineering. Among such institutions, the most renown (and hardest to gain admission) are [[École Centrale Paris|Ecole Centrale Paris (Centrale)]], [[Mines ParisTech|Ecole des Mines de Paris (Mines Paristech)]], [[Arts et Métiers ParisTech|Ecole Nationale Supérieure d'Arts et Métiers]], [[École Polytechnique|Ecole Polytechnique]], and [[Ecole des Ponts ParisTech]]. Engineering schools which were created during the French revolution have a special reputation among the French people, as they helped to make the transition from a mostly agricultural country of late 18th century to the industrially developed France of the 19th century. A great part of 19th century France's economic wealth and industrial prowess was created by engineers that have graduated from [[École Centrale Paris|Ecole Centrale Paris]], [[Mines ParisTech|Ecole des Mines de Paris]], or [[École Polytechnique|Ecole Polytechnique]]. This was also the case after the WWII when France had to be rebuilt.<br />\n<br />\nBefore the &quot;réforme [[René Haby]]&quot; in the 70's, it was very difficult to be admitted to such schools, and the French ''ingénieurs'' were commonly perceived as the nation's elite (hence the term  &quot;faire les [[Grandes écoles|Grandes Écoles]]&quot; in language of older people). However, after the Haby reform and a string of further reforms ([[Modernization plans of French universities]]), several engineering schools were created which can be accessed with relatively lower competition, and this reputation as being part of the French elite now applies to those from 'top' engineering schools for engineers, [[École nationale d'administration|École Nationale d'Administration (ENA)]] for managers or politicians and [[École normale supérieure|École Normale Supérieure (ENS)]] for researchers in science and humanities. Engineers are less highlighted in current French economy as industry provides less than a quarter of the GDP.<br />\n<br />\n=== North America ===<br />\nIn the US and Canada, engineering is a regulated profession whose practice and practitioners are licensed and governed by law.  Licensed professional engineers in Canada and the USA are referred to as P.Eng (Canada) and PE (USA).  A 2002 study by the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers revealed that engineers are the third most respected professionals behind doctors and pharmacists.&lt;ref&gt;Ontario Society of Professional Engineers, 2002, [http://www.ospe.on.ca/pdf/Newsletter-Feb-2002.pdf Engineering: One of Ontario's most respected professions]&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n[[File:Auto Rice Milling Plants.jpg|thumb|left|180x180px|Auto rice milling machinery in Bangladesh]]<br />\nIn Ontario, and all other Canadian provinces, the &quot;title&quot; Engineer is protected by law and any non-licensed  individual or company using the title is committing a legal offense, and can get fined&lt;ref&gt;Professional Engineers Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.28[https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90p28]&lt;/ref&gt;. Companies usually prefer not to use the title except for license holders because of liability reasons, for instance, if the company filed a lawsuit and the judge,  investigators, or lawyers found that the company is using the word engineer for non licensed employees this could be used by opponents to hinder the company's efforts.<br />\n<br />\n=== Asia and Africa ===<br />\nIn the [[Indian subcontinent]], [[Russia]], Middle East, Africa, and [[China]], engineering is one of the most sought after undergraduate courses, inviting thousands of applicants to show their ability in highly competitive entrance examinations.<br />\n<br />\nIn [[Egypt]], the [[Education in Egypt|educational system]] makes engineering the second-most-respected profession in the country (after medicine); engineering colleges at [[Egyptian universities]] require extremely high marks on the General Certificate of Secondary Education ({{lang-ar|الثانوية العامة}} ''al-Thānawiyyah al-`Āmmah'')&amp;mdash;on the order of 97 or 98%&amp;mdash;and are thus considered (along with the colleges of medicine, natural science, and pharmacy) to be among the &quot;pinnacle colleges&quot; ({{lang|ar|كليات القمة}} ''kullīyāt al-qimmah'').<br />\n<br />\nIn the [[Philippines]] and [[Overseas Filipino|Filipino communities overseas]], engineers who are either Filipino or not, especially those who also profess other jobs at the same time, are addressed and introduced as ''Engineer'', rather than ''Sir/Madam'' in speech or ''Mr./Mrs./Ms.'' (''G./Gng./Bb.'' in Filipino) before surnames. That word is used either in itself or before the given name or surname.<br />\n<br />\n===Corporate culture===<br />\nIn companies and other organizations, there is sometimes a tendency to undervalue people with advanced technological and scientific skills compared to celebrities, fashion practitioners, entertainers, and [[Management|managers]]. In his book, ''[[The Mythical Man-Month]]'',&lt;ref&gt;The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering, p119 (see also p242), Frederick P. Brooks, Jr., University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 2nd ed. 1995, pub. Addison-Wesley&lt;/ref&gt; Fred Brooks Jr says that managers think of senior people as &quot;too valuable&quot; for technical tasks and that management jobs carry higher prestige. He tells how some laboratories, such as Bell Labs, abolish all job titles to overcome this problem: a professional employee is a &quot;member of the technical staff.&quot; IBM maintain a dual ladder of advancement; the corresponding managerial and engineering or scientific rungs are equivalent. Brooks recommends that structures need to be changed; the boss must give a great deal of attention to keeping his managers and his technical people as interchangeable as their talents allow.<br />\n<br />\n==See also==<br />\n{{Portal|Engineering}}<br />\n{{Wiktionary|engineer}}<br />\n{{Commons category|Engineers}}<br />\n* [[Building engineer]]<br />\n* [[Engineer's degree]]<br />\n* [[Engineers Without Borders]]<br />\n* [[Greatest Engineering Achievements]]<br />\n* [[History of engineering]]<br />\n* [[List of engineering branches]]<br />\n* [[List of engineers]]<br />\n* [[List of fictional scientists and engineers]]<br />\n* [[Washington Accord]]<br />\n<br />\n==References==<br />\n{{Reflist|30em}}<br />\n<br />\n{{Engineering fields}}<br />\n{{Technology}}<br />\n<br />\n{{Authority control}}<br />\n<br />\n[[Category:Engineering occupations]]<br />\n[[Category:Engineers| ]]<br />\n[[Category:Science occupations]]</div>",

The T-26 was slow-moving, designed to keep pace with infantry on the ground. The BT tanks were [[cavalry tank]]s: fast-moving and light, designed for maneuver warfare. Both were Soviet developments of foreign designs from the early 1930s; the T-26 was based on the British [[Vickers 6-Ton]], and the BT tanks were based on a design from American engineer [[J.

The [[prototype]] tank, designated A-20, was specified with {{cvt|20|mm|in|1}} of [[vehicle armour|armour]], a 45&amp;nbsp;mm (1.77&amp;nbsp;in) gun, and the new [[Diesel model V-2|Model V-2-34]] engine, using less-flammable diesel fuel in a [[V12 engine|V12]] configuration designed by [[Chelpan Konstantin Fyodorovich|Konstantin Chelpan]]. It also had an 8×6-wheel convertible drive similar to the BT tank's 8×2, which allowed it to run on wheels without [[caterpillar track]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Zheltov-1999|Zheltov 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt; This feature had greatly saved on maintenance and repair of the unreliable tank tracks of the early 1930s, and allowed tanks to exceed {{convert|85|km/h}} on roads, but gave no advantage in combat and its complexity made it difficult to maintain. By 1937–38, track design had improved and the designers considered it a waste of space, weight, and maintenance resources, despite the road speed advantage.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Zaloga-1984|Zaloga &amp; Grandsen 1984:66, 111]]&lt;/ref&gt; The A-20 also incorporated previous research (BT-IS and BT-SW-2 projects) into [[sloped armour]]: its all-round sloped armour plates were more likely to deflect rounds than perpendicular armour.&lt;ref&gt;Yaziv, D.; Chocron, S.; Anderson, Jr., C.E.; Grosch, D.J. &quot;Oblique Penetration in Ceramic Targets&quot;.

Although the IJA [[Type 95 Ha-Go]] light tanks had [[diesel engine]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zaloga|2007|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Red Army's T-26 and BT tanks used petrol engines which, while common in tank designs of the time, often burst into flames when hit by IJA tank-killer teams&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Coox|Coox 1990:311]]&lt;/ref&gt; using [[Molotov cocktail]]s. Poor quality welds in the Soviet armour plates left small gaps between them, and flaming petrol from the Molotov cocktails easily seeped into the fighting and engine compartment; portions of the armour plating that had been assembled with [[rivet]]s also proved to be vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Coox|Coox 1990:309]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet tanks were also easily destroyed by the Japanese Type 95 tank's 37&amp;nbsp;mm gunfire, despite the low velocity of that gun,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Coox|Coox 1990:437, 993]]&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;at any other slightest provocation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Zaloga-1984|Zaloga &amp; Grandsen 1984:111]]&lt;/ref&gt; The use of riveted armour led to a problem whereby the impact of enemy shells, even if they failed to disable the tank or kill the crew on their own, would cause the rivets to break off and become projectiles inside the tank.<br />\n<br />\n[[File:Medium tank A-32.jpg|thumbnail|Medium tank A-32]]<br />\nAfter these battles, Koshkin convinced Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] to let him develop a second prototype, a more heavily armed and armoured &quot;universal tank&quot; that reflected the lessons learned and could replace both the T-26 and the BT tanks. Koshkin named the second prototype A-32, after its {{cvt|32|mm|in|1}} of frontal armour. It had an L-10 76.2&amp;nbsp;mm (3&amp;nbsp;in) gun, and the same Model V-2-34 diesel.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Zaloga-1994|Zaloga &amp; Sarson 1994:5]]&lt;/ref&gt; Both were tested in [[quality control|field trials]] at [[Kubinka]] in 1939, with the heavier A-32 proving to be as mobile as the A-20. A still heavier version of the A-32, with 45&amp;nbsp;mm (1.77&amp;nbsp;in) of front armour, wider tracks, and a newer L-11 76.2&amp;nbsp;mm gun, was approved for production as the T-34.

Alexander Morozov personally supervised the evacuation of all skilled engineers and laborers, machinery and stock from KhPZ to re-establish the factory at the site of the [[Uralvagonzavod|Dzerzhinsky Ural Railcar Factory]] in [[Nizhny Tagil]], renamed Stalin Ural Tank Factory N.183.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Zaloga-1983|Zaloga &amp; Grandsen 1983:17]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Kirovsky Factory, evacuated just weeks before the Germans surrounded Leningrad, moved with the Kharkov Diesel Factory to the [[Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant|Stalin Tractor Factory]] in [[Chelyabinsk]], soon to be nicknamed ''Tankograd'' (&quot;Tank City&quot;). The workers and machinery from Leningrad's Voroshilov Tank Factory N.174 were incorporated into the Ural Factory and the new Omsk Factory N.174. The [[Uralmash|Ordzhonikidze Ural Heavy Machine Tool Works]] (UZTM) in [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]] absorbed workers and machines from several small machine shops in the path of German forces.<br />\n<br />\nWhile these factories were being rapidly moved, the industrial complex surrounding the [[Volgograd Tractor Factory|Dzerzhinsky Tractor Factory]] in Stalingrad continued to work double shifts throughout the period of withdrawal (September 1941 to September 1942) to make up for production lost, and produced 40% of all T-34s during the period.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Zaloga-1983|Zaloga &amp; Grandsen 1983:13]]&lt;/ref&gt; As the factory became surrounded by heavy fighting in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in 1942, the situation there grew desperate: manufacturing innovations were necessitated by material shortages, and stories persist of unpainted T-34 tanks driven out of the factory directly to the battlefields around it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Zaloga-1994|Zaloga &amp; Sarson 1994:23]]&lt;/ref&gt; Stalingrad kept up production until September 1942.<br />\n<br />\nSoviet designers were aware of design deficiencies in the tank, but most of the desired remedies would have slowed tank production and so were not implemented: the only changes allowed on the production lines through to 1944 were those to make production simpler and cheaper.

Both chassis were used as the foundation for a variety of support vehicles, such as armour recovery vehicles, [[tank destroyer]]s, and self-propelled artillery.

Tank commander A.K. Rodkin commented: &quot;the tank could have dug the ground with it in the smallest ditch [filling the barrel with dirt]. If you fired it after that, the barrel would open up at the end like the petals of a flower&quot;, destroying the barrel. Standard practice when moving the T-34-85 cross-country in non-combat situations was to fully elevate the gun, or reverse the turret.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Drabkin|Drabkin &amp; Sheremet 2006:33]]&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\n===Mobility===<br />\n[[File:T34 engine parola 1.jpg|thumb|upright|The T-34's 12-cylinder Model V-2-34 diesel engine at the [[Parola Tank Museum|Finnish Tank Museum]] in [[Parola]]]]<br />\n<br />\nThe T-34 was powered by a [[Diesel model V-2|Model V-2-34]] 38.8&amp;nbsp;L [[V12 engine|V12]] [[Diesel engine]] of 500&amp;nbsp;hp (370&amp;nbsp;kW),&lt;ref name=&quot;Engine-name&quot; group=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;The name of the T-34's engine (V-2; B-2 in Russian) is a model name, and has nothing to do with its number of cylinders.&lt;/ref&gt; giving a top speed of 53&amp;nbsp;km/h (33&amp;nbsp;mph).

In addition, its pneumatic engine starting system, fed from a compressed air cylinder mounted inside the tank's bow, remained reliable even in the coldest conditions.

The two-man [[gun turret|turret]] crew arrangement required the commander to aim and fire the gun, an arrangement common to most Soviet tanks of the day. The two-man turret was &quot;cramped and inefficient&quot; {{sfn|Hughes|Mann|2002|p=63}} and was inferior to the three-man (commander, gunner, and loader) turret crews of German Panzer III and Panzer IV tanks.

Nicknamed ''[[pirozhok]]'' (stuffed bun) because of its characteristic shape, it was heavy and hard to open. The complaints of the crews urged the design group led by Alexander Morozov to switch in August 1942&lt;ref&gt;http://english.battlefield.ru/t-34.html&lt;/ref&gt; to using two hatches in the turret.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Drabkin|Drabkin &amp; Sheremet 2006:27-28]]&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\nThe loader also had a difficult job due to the lack of a turret basket (a rotating floor that moves as the turret turns); the same fault was present on all German tanks prior to the Panzer IV. The floor under the T-34's turret was made up of ammunition stored in small metal boxes, covered by a rubber mat. There were nine ready rounds of ammunition stowed in racks on the sides of the fighting compartment. Once these rounds had been used, the crew had to pull additional ammunition out of the floor boxes, leaving the floor littered with open bins and matting and reducing their performance.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Zaloga-1984|Zaloga &amp; Grandsen 1984:137]]&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\n{{quotation|The main weakness [of the two-man turret of a T-34 Model 1941] is that it is very tight.

Early in the tank's life, however, this advantage was greatly reduced by the numerous teething troubles the design displayed: a long road trip could be a lethal exercise for a T-34 tank at the start of the war. When in June 1941, the [[8th Mechanised Corps]] of [[D.I. Ryabyshev]] marched towards Dubno, the corps lost half of its vehicles. A.V.

Larger numbers of the [[88mm flak gun|88&amp;nbsp;mm ''Flak'']] guns also arrived, which could easily defeat a T-34 at very long ranges, though their size and general unwieldiness meant that they were often difficult to move into position in the rough Russian terrain.&lt;ref&gt;Gander and Chamberlain, 1979:119&lt;/ref&gt; The heavy German [[Tiger I]] tank appeared on the Eastern Front in late 1942, as a response to the T-34.<br />\n<br />\nAt the same time, the Soviets incrementally upgraded the T-34. The Model 1942 featured increased armour on the turret and many simplified components. The Model 1943 (confusingly also introduced in 1942) had yet more armour, as well as increased fuel capacity and more ammunition storage. Also added were an improved engine air filter and a new clutch mated to an improved and more reliable five-speed transmission.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zaloga 2006&quot; /&gt; Finally, the Model 1943 also had a new, slightly roomier (but still two-man) turret of a distinctive hexagonal shape that was easier to manufacture, derived from the abandoned [[T-34 variants#Tanks|T-34M]] project.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot; /&gt;<br />\n<br />\nThe T-34 was essential in resisting the German summer offensive in 1942, and executing the double encirclement manoeuver that cut off the German Sixth Army at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] in December 1942. The Sixth Army was surrounded, and eventually surrendered in February 1943, a campaign widely regarded as the turning point of the war on the Eastern Front.<br />\n<br />\nIn 1943, the Soviets formed [[Polish Armed Forces in the East|Polish]] and [[I Corps (Czechoslovakia)|Czechoslovak]] armies-in-exile, and these started to receive the T-34 Model 1943 with a hexagonal turret. Like the Soviet forces themselves, the Polish and Czechoslovak tank crews were sent into action quickly with little training, and suffered high casualties.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} The Czechoslovak crews of T-34 saw their first action in the [[Battle of Kiev (1943)|Battle of Kiev]] in November 1943.

It was the debut of the German [[Panther tank]], although the numbers employed at Kursk were small and the brunt of the burden was carried by the [[Panzer III]], [[Sturmgeschütz III|StuG III]], and [[Panzer IV]]. The campaign featured the largest tank battles in history. The high-water mark of the battle was the massive armour engagement at [[Battle of Prokhorovka|Prokhorovka]], which began on 12 July, though the vast majority of armour losses on both sides were caused by artillery and mines, rather than tanks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prokhorovka Interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zamulin|first1=Valeriy|title=Prokhorovka Interview|url=http://worldoftanks.ru/ru/news/pc-browser/12/prokhorovka_interview_zamulin/?|website=World of Tanks|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 6,000 fully tracked armoured vehicles, 4,000 combat aircraft, and 2 million men are believed to have participated in these battles.<br />\n<br />\nThe Soviet high command's decision to focus on one cost-effective design, cutting costs and simplifying production wherever possible while only allowing relatively minor improvements, had proven to be an astute choice for the first two years of the war. However, the battles in the summer of 1943 demonstrated that the 76.2&amp;nbsp;mm gun of the T-34 was no longer as effective as it was in 1941. Soviet tank crews struggled at longer ranges with the additional frontal armour applied to the later variants of the Panzer III and Panzer IV, and were unable to penetrate the frontal armour of the new German Panther or Tiger I tank at standard combat ranges without tungsten rounds, and had to rely on tactical skill through flanking maneuvers and combined arms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prokhorovka Interview&quot; /&gt;<br />\n<br />\n===T-34-85===<br />\n[[File:P82-2l.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A T-34 Model 1943 (left), next to the [[T-43 medium tank|T-43]].]]<br />\nAfter improved German Panzer IVs with the high-velocity [[7.5 cm KwK 40|75&amp;nbsp;mm (2.95&amp;nbsp;in) gun]] were encountered in combat in 1942, a project to design an entirely new Soviet tank was begun, with the goals of increasing armour protection while adding modern features like a [[torsion-bar]] suspension and a three-man turret. This new tank, the [[T-43 medium tank|T-43]], was intended to be a universal tank to replace both the T-34 and the [[KV-1 (tank)|KV-1]] heavy tank. However, the T-43 prototype's armour, though heavier, was still not proof against German 88&amp;nbsp;mm guns, while its mobility was found to be inferior to the T-34. Finally, although the T-43 shared over 70% of its components with the T-34, manufacturing it would still have required a significant slow-down in production.&lt;ref name=&quot;zaloga1997&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Zaloga-1997|Zaloga et al. 1997:5]]&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the T-43 was cancelled.<br />\n<br />\nNot only were the weapons of German tanks improving, so was their armour. Soviet firing tests against a captured Tiger I heavy tank in April 1943 showed that the T-34's 76&amp;nbsp;mm gun could not penetrate the front of the Tiger I at all, and the side only at the very close range. A Soviet 85&amp;nbsp;mm anti-aircraft gun, the [[85 mm air defense gun M1939 (52-K)|52-K]], was found capable of doing the job, and so derivatives of it were developed for tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eugene Boldyrev |url=http://www.battlefield.ru/content/view/87/43/lang,en/ |title=Средний танк Т-34-85 – The Russian Battlefield |publisher=Battlefield.ru |date=2005-09-20 |accessdate=2010-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Healy 2008:167–171&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting tank gun could penetrate the side armour of the Tiger I from a distance of 800 meters and the turret side from a distance of 600 meters. It was still not enough to match the Tiger, as a Tiger could destroy the T-34 from a distance of 1,500 to 2,000 meters,&lt;ref name=&quot;auto4&quot; /&gt; but it was a noticeable improvement.<br />\n<br />\n[[File:T34-85 Heckansicht.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of a T-34-85 from Factory 174.

Its turret ring was enlarged from 1,425&amp;nbsp;mm (56&amp;nbsp;in) to 1,600&amp;nbsp;mm (63&amp;nbsp;in), allowing a larger turret to be fitted and thus the larger 85&amp;nbsp;mm gun. The prototype T-43's turret design was hurriedly adopted by Vyacheslav Kerichev at the [[Krasnoye Sormovo Factory]] to fit the T-34.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Zaloga-1984|Zaloga &amp; Grandsen 1984:166]]&lt;/ref&gt; This was a larger three-man turret, with radio (previously in the hull) and observation cupola in the roof. Now the tank commander needed only to command (aided by cupola and radio systems), leaving the operation of the gun to the gunner and the loader. The turret armour was much thicker, 90&amp;nbsp;mm, even if bigger and less sloped than the original T-34 turret. This made the turret, overall, a bigger target (due to the three-man crew and bigger gun), but more resistant to enemy fire. The ammunition load shrank from around 90-100 to 55-60 shells, but the projectiles were 50% heavier (9&amp;nbsp;kg) and were much better in the anti-armour role, and reasonable in a general purpose role. The resulting new tank, the T-34-85, was seen as a compromise between advocates for the T-43 and others who wanted to continue to build as many 76&amp;nbsp;mm-armed T-34s as possible without interruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=63|title=T-34/85 – Medium Tank – History, Specs and Pictures – Military Tanks, Vehicles and Artillery|publisher=|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\n[[File:T-34-85 interior Parola Tank Museum.jpg|thumb|Interior of a T-34-85 viewed from the driver's hatch, showing the ammunition boxes on which the loader had to stand in the absence of a turret basket.

While it could not match the armour or weapons of the heavier Panther and Tiger tanks, its improved firepower made it much more effective than earlier models, and overall it was more cost-effective than the heaviest German tanks. In comparison with the T-34-85 program, the Germans instead chose an upgrade path based on the introduction of completely new, expensive, heavier, and more complex tanks, greatly slowing the growth of their tank production and aiding the Soviets in maintaining a substantial numerical superiority in tanks.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Zaloga-1983|Zaloga &amp; Grandsen 1983:37]]&lt;/ref&gt; By May 1944, T-34-85 production had reached 1,200 tanks per month.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Zaloga-1997|Zaloga et al. 1997:6]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the entire war, production figures for all Panther types reached no more than 6,557, and for all Tiger types (including the Tiger I and Tiger II) 2,027.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Philo, &quot;[http://www.taphilo.com/history/WWII/Production-Figures-WWII.shtml Selected Equipment Production Figures World War II]&quot;. at ''Tom Philo Photography'' website, retrieved on July 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Production figures for the T-34-85 alone reached 22,559.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}<br />\n<br />\n===German use of T-34s===<br />\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-277-0836-04, Russland, erbeutete russische T-34 Panzer.jpg|thumb|Captured T-34 Model 1943 tanks pressed into service with the [[Wehrmacht]], January 1944]]<br />\n<br />\nThe German army often employed as much captured [[materiel]] as possible and T-34s were not an exception.

From late 1941, captured T-34s were transported to a German workshop for repairs and modification to German requirements. In 1943 a local tank factory in [[Kharkov]] was used for this purpose.

The opposing Japanese forces had been reduced as elite units had been drawn off to other fronts and the remaining forces were in the middle of a redeployment. The Japanese tanks remaining to face them were all held in the rear and not used in combat; the Japanese had weak support from [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force|IJAAF]] forces, engineering, and communications.

The bomber, [[Josef Kneifel]], was sentenced to life imprisonment in [[Bautzen]], but was released after a deal with the West German government in 1987. After [[German unification]] in 1990, the tank was transferred to a museum in Ingolstadt.&lt;ref&gt;Honnigfort, Bernhard. &quot;Der Panzersprenger.&quot; ''Frankfurter Rundschau'', April 15, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Honnigfort, Bernhard. &quot;Der sich nicht fügen wollte.&quot; ''Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger'', April 17, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\nAnother such tank, mounted atop the [[monument to Soviet tank crews]] in [[Prague]], was the focus of significant controversy. The monument (known locally as 'Saint Tank') was intended to represent Lt I.G. Goncharenko's T-34-85 (the first Soviet tank to enter Prague in May 1945), but actually bore an [[Iosif Stalin tank|IS-2M]] heavy tank. To many in Prague, the tank was also a reminder of the Soviet invasion which ended the [[Prague Spring]] of 1968. The tank was painted pink by artist [[David Černý]] in 1991. Following an official protest from the Russian government, the arrest of Černý, a coat of official green paint, public demonstrations, and a further coat of pink paint applied by fifteen parliamentary deputies, the tank was finally removed to a military museum.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Wright-2001|Wright 2001:379]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Zaloga-1996|Zaloga &amp; Kinnear 1996:42–43]]&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\n''Four Tankers and a Dog'' (''[[Czterej pancerni i pies]]''), a very successful war-themed [[Telewizja Polska|Polish television series]] of the 1960s, adapted the novel of the same name by the [[Polish literature|Polish writer]] [[Janusz Przymanowski]] (1922–1998), himself a [[People's Army of Poland]] volunteer.

The identification of T-34 variants can be complicated. Turret castings, superficial details, and equipment differed between factories; new features were added in the middle of production runs, or retrofitted to older tanks; damaged tanks were rebuilt, sometimes with the addition of newer-model equipment and even new turrets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zaloga-1983-14&quot; /&gt;<br />\n<br />\nThe Red Army never had a consistent policy for naming the T-34.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Zaloga-1994|Zaloga &amp; Sarson 1994:19]]&lt;/ref&gt; Since at least the 1980s, however, many academic sources (notably, [[armoured fighting vehicle|AFV]] expert [[Steven Zaloga]]) have used Soviet-style nomenclature: ''T-34'' for the models armed with 76.2&amp;nbsp;mm guns, and ''T-34-85'' for models armed with 85&amp;nbsp;mm guns, with minor models distinguished by year, as ''T-34 Model 1940''. Some Russian historians use different names: they refer to the first T-34 as the ''T-34 Model 1939'' instead of 1940, all T-34s with the original turret and F-34 gun as ''Model 1941'' instead of Models 1941 and 1942, and the [[hexagon]]al-turret T-34 as ''Model 1942'' instead of 1943.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Zheltov-2001|Zheltov 2001, passim]]&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\nGerman [[military intelligence]] in World War II referred to the two main production families as ''T-34/76'' and ''T-34/85'', with subvariants receiving letter designations such as ''T-34/76A'' — this nomenclature has been widely used in the West, especially in popular literature. When the German Wehrmacht used captured T-34s, it designated them ''Panzerkampfwagen T-34(r)'', where the &quot;r&quot; stood for ''russisch'' (&quot;Russian&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers, Bob.

However, as the situation continued to deteriorate from May–December 1979, Moscow changed its mind on dispatching Soviet troops.  The reasons for this complete turnabout are not entirely clear, and several speculative arguments include the grave internal situation and inability for the Afghan government, headed by Amin from 14 September 1979 after a successful coup, to quell the rebellion, the effects of the [[Iranian Revolution]] that brought an Islamic theocracy into power, leading to fears that religious fanaticism would spread through Afghanistan and into Soviet Muslim Central Asian republics, and the deteriorating ties with the United States with the failure of Congress to ratify the SALT II treaty and the impression that détente was &quot;already effectively dead.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/e-dossier_4.pdf |title=Documents on the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan e-Dossier No. 4. p. 70-75 |date=November 2001 |website= |publisher=Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars |accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\n===Soviet intervention and coup===<br />\n[[File:SovietInvasionAfghanistanMap.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The Soviet intervention]]<br />\n<br />\nOn October 31, 1979, Soviet informants under orders from the inner circle of advisors under Soviet president Brezhnev relayed information to the [[Afghan Armed Forces]] for them to undergo maintenance cycles for their tanks and other crucial equipment.

The Soviets would bomb villages that were near sites of guerrilla attacks on Soviet convoys or known to support resistance groups. Local peoples were forced to either flee their homes or die as daily Soviet attacks made it impossible to live in these areas. By forcing the people of Afghanistan to flee their homes, the Soviets hoped to deprive the guerrillas of resources and safe havens. The second strategy consisted of subversion, which entailed sending spies to join resistance groups and report information as well as bribing local tribes or guerrilla leaders into ceasing operations. Finally, the Soviets used military forays into contested territories in an effort to root out the [[guerrillas]] and limit their options. Classic [[search and destroy]] operations were implemented using [[Mil Mi-24]] helicopter gunships that would provide cover for ground forces in armored vehicles. Once the villages were occupied by Soviet forces, inhabitants who remained were frequently interrogated and tortured for information or killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Report from Afghanistan&quot;&gt;[http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/afghan/report.pdf Report from Afghanistan] Claude Malhuret&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\n[[File:Afghan village destroyed by the Soviets.jpg|thumb|An Afghan village left in ruins after being destroyed by [[Soviet Armed Forces|Soviet forces]]]]<br />\n<br />\nTo complement their brute force approach to weeding out the [[insurgency]], the Soviets used [[KHAD]] (Afghan secret police) to gather intelligence, infiltrate the mujahideen, spread false information, bribe tribal militias into fighting and organize a government [[militia]].

The Maoist resistance eventually lost its pace and was severely weakened following the deaths of leaders [[Faiz Ahmad]] and [[Mulavi Dawood]] in 1986, both committed by the [[Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin]] mujahideen faction.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}<br />\n<br />\n[[File:Afghanistan insurgency 1985.png|thumb|left|The areas where the different mujahideen forces operated in 1985]]<br />\n<br />\nIn the course of the guerrilla war, leadership came to be distinctively associated with the title of &quot;commander&quot;. It applied to independent leaders, eschewing identification with elaborate military [[bureaucracy]] associated with such ranks as general. As the war produced leaders of reputation, &quot;commander&quot; was conferred on leaders of fighting units of all sizes, signifying pride in independence, self-sufficiency, and distinct ties to local communities. The title epitomized Afghan pride in their struggle against a powerful foe. Segmentation of power and religious leadership were the two values evoked by nomenclature generated in the war. Neither had been favored in the ideology of the former Afghan state.<br />\n<br />\nAfghanistan's resistance movement was born in chaos, spread and triumphed chaotically, and did not find a way to govern differently. Virtually all of its war was waged locally by regional [[warlord]]s. As warfare became more sophisticated, outside support and regional coordination grew. Even so, the basic units of mujahideen organization and action continued to reflect the highly segmented nature of Afghan society.&lt;ref name=&quot;loc1&quot;&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0101) The Path to Victory and Chaos: 1979–92 – Library of Congress country studies](Retrieved Thursday 31, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\n[[Olivier Roy (professor)|Olivier Roy]] estimates that after four years of war, there were at least 4,000 bases from which mujahideen units operated. Most of these were affiliated with the seven expatriate parties headquartered in Pakistan, which served as sources of supply and varying degrees of supervision. Significant commanders typically led 300 or more men, controlled several bases and dominated a district or a sub-division of a province. Hierarchies of organization above the bases were attempted. Their operations varied greatly in scope, the most ambitious being achieved by [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] of the [[Panjshir valley]] north of [[Kabul]]. He led at least 10,000 trained troopers at the end of the Soviet war and had expanded his political control of [[Tajiks|Tajik]]-dominated areas to Afghanistan's northeastern provinces under the Supervisory Council of the North.&lt;ref name=&quot;loc1&quot; /&gt;<br />\n<br />\nRoy also describes regional, ethnic and sectarian variations in mujahideen organization. In the [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] areas of the east, south and southwest, tribal structure, with its many rival sub-divisions, provided the basis for military organization and leadership. Mobilization could be readily linked to traditional fighting allegiances of the tribal ''lashkar'' (fighting force). In favorable circumstances such formations could quickly reach more than 10,000, as happened when large Soviet assaults were launched in the eastern provinces, or when the mujahideen besieged towns, such as [[Khost]] in [[Paktia]] province in July 1983.&lt;ref&gt;The siege was ended only in November 1987 through the conduct of Operation Magistal'&lt;/ref&gt; But in campaigns of the latter type the traditional explosions of manpower—customarily common immediately after the completion of harvest—proved obsolete when confronted by well dug-in defenders with modern weapons. Lashkar durability was notoriously short; few sieges succeeded.&lt;ref name=&quot;loc1&quot;/&gt;<br />\n<br />\nMujahideen mobilization in non-Pashtun regions faced very different obstacles. Prior to the intervention, few non-Pashtuns possessed firearms. Early in the war they were most readily available from army troops or [[gendarmerie]] who defected or were ambushed. The international arms market and foreign military support tended to reach the minority areas last. In the northern regions, little military tradition had survived upon which to build an armed resistance. Mobilization mostly came from political leadership closely tied to Islam. Roy contrasts the social leadership of religious figures in the [[Persian language|Persian]]- and [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking regions of Afghanistan with that of the Pashtuns. Lacking a strong political representation in a state dominated by Pashtuns, minority communities commonly looked to pious learned or charismatically revered ''[[pir (Sufism)|pirs]]'' (saints) for leadership. Extensive [[Sufi]] and [[maraboutic]] networks were spread through the minority communities, readily available as foundations for leadership, organization, communication and indoctrination. These networks also provided for political mobilization, which led to some of the most effective of the resistance operations during the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;loc1&quot; /&gt;<br />\n<br />\nThe mujahideen favoured [[sabotage]] operations. The more common types of sabotage included damaging [[electric power transmission|power lines]], knocking out [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] and radio stations, blowing up government [[office building]]s, [[air terminal]]s, hotels, cinemas, and so on. In the border region with Pakistan, the mujahideen would often launch 800 [[rocket]]s per day. Between April 1985 and January 1987, they carried out over 23,500 [[shell (projectile)|shelling]] attacks on government targets. The mujahideen surveyed firing positions that they normally located near villages within the range of Soviet artillery posts, putting the villagers in danger of death from Soviet retaliation. The mujahideen used [[land mines]] heavily. Often, they would enlist the services of the local inhabitants, even children.<br />\n<br />\n[[File:Mujahideen prayer in Shultan Valley Kunar, 1987.jpg|thumb|Mujahideen praying in Shultan Valley, 1987]]<br />\n<br />\nThey concentrated on both civilian and military targets, knocking out bridges, closing major roads, attacking [[convoy]]s, disrupting the electric power system and industrial production, and attacking police stations and Soviet military installations and air bases. They assassinated government officials and PDPA members, and laid siege to small rural outposts. In March 1982, a bomb exploded at the [[Ministry (government department)|Ministry]] of Education, damaging several buildings. In the same month, a widespread [[power failure]] darkened Kabul when a pylon on the transmission line from the Naghlu power station was blown up. In June 1982 a column of about 1,000 young [[communist party]] members sent out to work in the Panjshir valley were ambushed within 30&amp;nbsp;km of Kabul, with heavy loss of life. On September 4, 1985, insurgents shot down a domestic Bakhtar Airlines plane as it took off from Kandahar airport, killing all 52 people aboard.<br />\n<br />\nMujahideen groups used for assassination had three to five men in each. After they received their mission to kill certain government officials, they busied themselves with studying his pattern of life and its details and then selecting the method of fulfilling their established mission. They practiced shooting at automobiles, [[drive by|shooting out of automobiles]], laying mines in government accommodation or houses, using poison, and rigging explosive charges in transport.<br />\n<br />\nIn May 1985, the seven principal rebel organizations formed the [[Seven Party Mujahideen Alliance]] to coordinate their military operations against the Soviet army.

During this phase, the Soviet contingent was restricted to supporting the DRA forces by providing [[artillery]], air support and technical assistance, though some large-scale operations were still carried out by Soviet troops.<br />\n<br />\nUnder Soviet guidance, the DRA armed forces were built up to an official strength of 302,000 in 1986. To minimize the risk of a coup d'état, they were divided into different branches, each modeled on its Soviet counterpart. The ministry of defence forces numbered 132,000, the ministry of interior 70,000 and the ministry of state security ([[KHAD]]) 80,000. However, these were theoretical figures: in reality each service was plagued with [[desertion]]s, the army alone suffering 32,000 per year.<br />\n<br />\nThe decision to engage primarily Afghan forces was taken by the Soviets, but was resented by the PDPA, who viewed the departure of their protectors without enthusiasm. In May 1987 a DRA force attacked well-entrenched mujahideen positions in the [[Arghandab District]], but the mujahideen held their ground, and the attackers suffered heavy casualties.&lt;ref&gt;Urban, ''War in Afghanistan'', p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1986, an offensive into [[Paktia Province]] briefly occupied the mujahideen base at [[Battles of Zhawar|Zhawar]] only at the cost of heavy losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grau, Lester &amp; [[Ali Ahmad Jalali|Jalali, Ali Ahmad]]|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/2001/010900-zhawar.htm|title=The campaign for the caves: the battles for Zhawar in the Soviet-Afghan War|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|accessdate=March 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the mujahideen benefited from expanded foreign military support from the United States, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and other Muslim nations.

Gorbachev had been attempting to remove the Soviet Union from the economic stagnation that had set in, under the leadership of Premier Brezhnev, and reform the Soviet Union's economy and image across the board with [[Glasnost]] and [[Perestroika]]. Gorbachev had also been attempting to ease cold war tensions by signing the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]] in 1987 with the U.S. and withdrawing the troops from Afghanistan whose presence had garnered so much international condemnation. Gorbachev regarded confrontation with China and resulting military build ups on that border as one of Brezhnev's biggest mistakes.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Beijing had stipulated that a normalization of relations would have to wait until Moscow withdrew its army from Afghanistan (among other things) and in 1989 the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Maley, William  |author2=Saikal, Amin |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Soviet Withdrawal from Afghanistan|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Gorbachev pressured his Cuban allies in Angola to scale down activities and withdraw even though Soviet allies were faring somewhat better there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Urban, Mark|title=War in Afghanistan|year=1990|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page= 300}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets also pulled many of their troops out of [[Mongolia]] in 1987 where they were also having a far easier time than in Afghanistan and restrained the [[Cambodian–Vietnamese War|Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea]] to the point of an all out withdrawal in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Maley, William  |author2=Saikal, Amin |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Soviet Withdrawal from Afghanistan|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; This massive withdrawal of Soviet forces from such highly contested areas shows that the Soviet government's decision to leave Afghanistan was based upon a general change in Soviet foreign policy- from that of confrontation to avoidance of conflict wherever possible.<br />\n<br />\nIn the last phase, Soviet troops prepared and executed their withdrawal from Afghanistan, whilst limiting the launching of offensive operations by those who hadn't withdrawn yet.<br />\n<br />\nBy mid-1987 the Soviet Union announced that it would start withdrawing its forces. [[Sibghatullah Mojaddedi]] was selected as the head of the Interim Islamic State of Afghanistan, in an attempt to reassert its legitimacy against the Moscow-sponsored Kabul regime. Mojaddedi, as head of the Interim Afghan Government, met with then Vice President of the United States [[George H. W. Bush]], achieving a critical diplomatic victory for the Afghan resistance. Defeat of the Kabul government was their solution for peace.

It was weakened by divisions within the PDPA and the Parcham faction, and the regime's efforts to expand its base of support proved futile.

Years later, when Karmal's inability to consolidate his government had become obvious, Mikhail Gorbachev, then General Secretary of the [[Soviet Communist Party]], said, &quot;The main reason that there has been no national consolidation so far is that Comrade Karmal is hoping to continue sitting in Kabul with our help.&quot;{{cn|date=January 2019}}<br />\n<br />\n[[File:RIAN archive 644461 First stage in the Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|A column of Soviet BTR armored personnel carriers departing from Afghanistan.]]<br />\n<br />\nIn November 1986, [[Mohammad Najibullah]], former chief of the Afghan [[secret police]] ([[KHAD]]), was elected president and a new constitution was adopted.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} He also introduced in 1987 a policy of &quot;national reconciliation,&quot; devised by experts of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], and later used in other regions of the world.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Despite high expectations, the new policy neither made the Moscow-backed Kabul regime more popular, nor did it convince the insurgents to negotiate with the ruling government.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}<br />\n<br />\nInformal negotiations for a Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan had been underway since 1982.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} In 1988, the governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan, with the United States and Soviet Union serving as guarantors, signed an agreement settling the major differences between them known as the [[Geneva Accords (1988)|Geneva Accords]].

In this way, Najibullah had stabilized his political position enough to begin matching Moscow's moves toward withdrawal.

The large Red Army formations weren't mobile enough to engage small groups of Muj fighters that easily merged back into the terrain.&lt;ref name=Fremont-Barnes/&gt; The set strategy also meant that troops were discouraged from &quot;tactical initiative&quot;, essential in counter insurgency, because it &quot;tended to upset operational timing&quot;.&lt;ref name=Grau-201/&gt;<br />\n* The Russians used large scale offensives against Mujahideen strongholds, such as in the Panjshir Valley, which temporarily clearing those sectors and killed many civilians in addition to enemy combatants.

The peak number of Soviet troops during the war was 115,000. The bulk of these troops were conscripts, which led to poor combat performance in their Motor-Rifle Formations. However, the Russians did have their elite infantry units, such as the famed Spetsnaz, the VDV, and their recon infantry. The problem with their elite units was not combat effectiveness, but the fact that there were not enough of them and that they were employed incorrectly.&lt;ref name=Fremont-Barnes/&gt;<br />\n* Intelligence gathering, essential for successful COIN, was inadequate. The Soviets over-relied on less-than-accurate aerial recon and radio intercepts rather than their recon infantry and special forces.

As the war was viewed as &quot;a Russian war fought by non Russians against Afghans&quot;, outside of Russia it undermined the legitimacy of the Soviet Union as a trans-national political union.

Its design allowed it to be continuously refined to meet the constantly evolving needs of the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]: as the war went on it became more capable, but also quicker and cheaper to produce.

The T-26 was slow-moving, designed to keep pace with infantry on the ground. The BT tanks were [[cavalry tank]]s: fast-moving and light, designed for maneuver warfare. Both were Soviet developments of foreign designs from the early 1930s; the T-26 was based on the British [[Vickers 6-Ton]], and the BT tanks were based on a design from American engineer [[J. Walter Christie]].&lt;ref&gt;Sale, Richard.

The [[prototype]] tank, designated A-20, was specified with {{cvt|20|mm|in|1}} of [[vehicle armour|armour]], a 45&amp;nbsp;mm (1.77&amp;nbsp;in) gun, and the new [[Diesel model V-2|Model V-2-34]] engine, using less-flammable diesel fuel in a [[V12 engine|V12]] configuration designed by [[Chelpan Konstantin Fyodorovich|Konstantin Chelpan]]. It also had an 8×6-wheel convertible drive similar to the BT tank's 8×2, which allowed it to run on wheels without [[caterpillar track]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Zheltov-1999|Zheltov 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt; This feature had greatly saved on maintenance and repair of the unreliable tank tracks of the early 1930s, and allowed tanks to exceed {{convert|85|km/h}} on roads, but gave no advantage in combat and its complexity made it difficult to maintain. By 1937–38, track design had improved and the designers considered it a waste of space, weight, and maintenance resources, despite the road speed advantage.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Zaloga-1984|Zaloga &amp; Grandsen 1984:66, 111]]&lt;/ref&gt; The A-20 also incorporated previous research (BT-IS and BT-SW-2 projects) into [[sloped armour]]: its all-round sloped armour plates were more likely to deflect rounds than perpendicular armour.&lt;ref&gt;Yaziv, D.; Chocron, S.; Anderson, Jr., C.E.; Grosch, D.J. &quot;Oblique Penetration in Ceramic Targets&quot;.

Although the IJA [[Type 95 Ha-Go]] light tanks had [[diesel engine]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zaloga|2007|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Red Army's T-26 and BT tanks used petrol engines which, while common in tank designs of the time, often burst into flames when hit by IJA tank-killer teams&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Coox|Coox 1990:311]]&lt;/ref&gt; using [[Molotov cocktail]]s. Poor quality welds in the Soviet armour plates left small gaps between them, and flaming petrol from the Molotov cocktails easily seeped into the fighting and engine compartment; portions of the armour plating that had been assembled with [[rivet]]s also proved to be vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Coox|Coox 1990:309]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet tanks were also easily destroyed by the Japanese Type 95 tank's 37&amp;nbsp;mm gunfire, despite the low velocity of that gun,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Coox|Coox 1990:437, 993]]&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;at any other slightest provocation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Zaloga-1984|Zaloga &amp; Grandsen 1984:111]]&lt;/ref&gt; The use of riveted armour led to a problem whereby the impact of enemy shells, even if they failed to disable the tank or kill the crew on their own, would cause the rivets to break off and become projectiles inside the tank.<br />\n<br />\n[[File:Medium tank A-32.jpg|thumbnail|Medium tank A-32]]<br />\nAfter these battles, Koshkin convinced Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] to let him develop a second prototype, a more heavily armed and armoured &quot;universal tank&quot; that reflected the lessons learned and could replace both the T-26 and the BT tanks. Koshkin named the second prototype A-32, after its {{cvt|32|mm|in|1}} of frontal armour. It had an L-10 76.2&amp;nbsp;mm (3&amp;nbsp;in) gun, and the same Model V-2-34 diesel.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Zaloga-1994|Zaloga &amp; Sarson 1994:5]]&lt;/ref&gt; Both were tested in [[quality control|field trials]] at [[Kubinka]] in 1939, with the heavier A-32 proving to be as mobile as the A-20. A still heavier version of the A-32, with 45&amp;nbsp;mm (1.77&amp;nbsp;in) of front armour, wider tracks, and a newer L-11 76.2&amp;nbsp;mm gun, was approved for production as the T-34. Koshkin chose the name after the year 1934, when he began to formulate his ideas about the new tank, and to commemorate that year's decree expanding the armoured force and appointing [[Sergo Ordzhonikidze]] to head tank production.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Zaloga-1994|Zaloga &amp; Sarson 1994:6]]&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\nValuable lessons from Lake Khasan and Khalkhin Gol regarding armour protection, mobility, quality welding, and main guns were incorporated into the new T-34 tank, which represented a substantial improvement over the BT and T-26 tanks in all four areas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Coox|Coox 1990:998]]&lt;/ref&gt; Koshkin's team completed two prototype T-34s in January 1940. In April and May, they underwent a grueling {{convert|2000|km|adj=on}} drive from [[Kharkov]] to [[Moscow]] for a demonstration for the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] leaders, to the [[Mannerheim Line]] in [[Finland]], and back to Kharkov via [[Minsk]] and [[Kiev]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot; /&gt; Some [[powertrain|drivetrain]] shortcomings were identified and corrected.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Zaloga-1983|Zaloga &amp; Grandsen 1983:6]]&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\n===Initial production{{Anchor|Establishing and maintaining production|Production history}}===<br />\n[[File:T-34 Model 1940.jpg|thumb|left|Pre-production prototype A-34 with a complex single-piece hull front.]]<br />\n<br />\nPolitical pressure came from conservative elements in the army to redirect resources into building the older T-26 and BT tanks, or to cancel T-34 production pending completion of the more advanced [[T-34 variants#Tanks|T-34M]] design. This pressure was brought to bear by the developer of the [[Kliment Voroshilov tank|KV-1]] tank which was in competition with the T-34.<br />\n<br />\nResistance from the military command and concerns about high production cost were finally overcome by anxieties about the poor performance of Soviet tanks in the [[Winter War]] in Finland, and the effectiveness of German tanks during the [[Battle of France]]. The first production T-34s were completed in September 1940, completely replacing the production of the T-26, the BT series and the multi-turreted [[T-28]] medium tank at the KhPZ plant.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Zaloga-1994|Zaloga &amp; Sarson 1994:4]]&lt;/ref&gt; Koshkin died of pneumonia (exacerbated by the drive from Kharkov to Moscow) at the end of that month, and the T-34's drivetrain developer, [[Alexander Alexandrovich Morozov|Alexander Morozov]], was appointed Chief Designer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zaloga-1984-130&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Zaloga-1984|Zaloga &amp; Grandsen 1984:130]]&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\nThe T-34 posed new challenges for the Soviet industry.

Alexander Morozov personally supervised the evacuation of all skilled engineers and laborers, machinery and stock from KhPZ to re-establish the factory at the site of the [[Uralvagonzavod|Dzerzhinsky Ural Railcar Factory]] in [[Nizhny Tagil]], renamed Stalin Ural Tank Factory N.183.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Zaloga-1983|Zaloga &amp; Grandsen 1983:17]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Kirovsky Factory, evacuated just weeks before the Germans surrounded Leningrad, moved with the Kharkov Diesel Factory to the [[Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant|Stalin Tractor Factory]] in [[Chelyabinsk]], soon to be nicknamed ''Tankograd'' (&quot;Tank City&quot;). The workers and machinery from Leningrad's Voroshilov Tank Factory N.174 were incorporated into the Ural Factory and the new Omsk Factory N.174.

Both tanks were the backbone of the armoured units in their respective armies, both nations distributed these tanks to their allies, who also used them as the mainstay of their own armoured formations, and both were upgraded extensively and fitted with more powerful guns. Both were designed for mobility and ease of manufacture and maintenance, sacrificing some performance for these goals. Both chassis were used as the foundation for a variety of support vehicles, such as armour recovery vehicles, [[tank destroyer]]s, and self-propelled artillery. Both were an approximately even match for the standard German medium tank, the [[Panzer IV]], though each of these three tanks had particular advantages and weaknesses compared with the other two. Neither the T-34 nor the M4 was a match for Germany's heavier tanks, the [[Panther tank|Panther]] (technically a medium tank) or the [[Tiger I]]; the Soviets used the [[IS-2 heavy tank]] and the U.S. used the [[M26 Pershing]] as the heavy tanks of their forces instead.&lt;ref&gt;Zaloga &amp; Grandsen 1983:37&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; summary=&quot;Characteristics and production cost of the main models of T-34, T-34-85 and T-44&quot;<br />\n|+ Soviet medium tank models of World War II&lt;ref name=&quot;Zaloga 2006&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Zaloga-1984|Zaloga &amp; Grandsen (1984:113, 184)]], [[#Reference-Harrison-2002|Harrison (2002:181)]], [[#Reference-KMDB-2006|KMDB (2006)]].&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n|-<br />\n!

As a result, T-34 platoons lost the greater firepower of three independently operating tanks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zaloga-1994-40&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Zaloga-1994|Zaloga &amp; Sarson 1994:40]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}<br />\n<br />\nThe Germans also noted that the T-34 was very slow to find and engage targets, while their own tanks could typically get off three rounds for every one fired by the T-34.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zaloga-1994-40&quot; /&gt; When new German tanks types with thicker armour began appearing in mid-1942, the T-34's 76.2&amp;nbsp;mm cannon had to fire at their flanks to assure penetration. As a result, the T-34 was upgraded to the T-34-85 model. This model, with its [[85 mm air defense gun M1939 (52-K)|85&amp;nbsp;mm]] (3.35&amp;nbsp;in) ZiS gun, provided greatly increased firepower compared to the previous T-34's 76.2mm gun. The 85&amp;nbsp;mm gun could penetrate the turret front of a [[Tiger I]] tank from {{cvt|500|m|yd}} and the driver's front plate from {{cvt|300|m|yd}} at the side angle of 30 degrees, and the larger turret enabled the addition of another crew member, allowing the roles of commander and gunner to be separated and increasing the rate of fire and overall effectiveness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jentz and Doyle 1993:19–20&quot;&gt;Jentz and Doyle 1993:20.&lt;/ref&gt; Against the frontal armour of the [[Panther tank|Panther]] at 30 degrees sidewards, the T-34-85 could not penetrate the non-[[Gun mantlet|mantlet]] of its turret at {{cvt|500|m|yd}},&lt;ref name=&quot;Jentz 1995:128&quot; /&gt; meaning that even upgraded models of the T-34 usually needed tungsten rounds or had to flank a Panther to destroy it.&lt;ref&gt;Healy 2008:167–172&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--sentence doesn't make sense--&gt;{{clarify|date=April 2016}}<br />\n<br />\nThe greater length of the 85&amp;nbsp;mm gun barrel (4.645 meters) made it necessary for crews to be careful not to plow it into the ground on bumpy roads or in combat. Tank commander A.K. Rodkin commented: &quot;the tank could have dug the ground with it in the smallest ditch [filling the barrel with dirt]. If you fired it after that, the barrel would open up at the end like the petals of a flower&quot;, destroying the barrel. Standard practice when moving the T-34-85 cross-country in non-combat situations was to fully elevate the gun, or reverse the turret.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Drabkin|Drabkin &amp; Sheremet 2006:33]]&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\n===Mobility===<br />\n[[File:T34 engine parola 1.jpg|thumb|upright|The T-34's 12-cylinder Model V-2-34 diesel engine at the [[Parola Tank Museum|Finnish Tank Museum]] in [[Parola]]]]<br />\n<br />\nThe T-34 was powered by a [[Diesel model V-2|Model V-2-34]] 38.8&amp;nbsp;L [[V12 engine|V12]] [[Diesel engine]] of 500&amp;nbsp;hp (370&amp;nbsp;kW),&lt;ref name=&quot;Engine-name&quot; group=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;The name of the T-34's engine (V-2; B-2 in Russian) is a model name, and has nothing to do with its number of cylinders.&lt;/ref&gt; giving a top speed of 53&amp;nbsp;km/h (33&amp;nbsp;mph).

In addition, its pneumatic engine starting system, fed from a compressed air cylinder mounted inside the tank's bow, remained reliable even in the coldest conditions.

The two-man [[gun turret|turret]] crew arrangement required the commander to aim and fire the gun, an arrangement common to most Soviet tanks of the day. The two-man turret was &quot;cramped and inefficient&quot; {{sfn|Hughes|Mann|2002|p=63}} and was inferior to the three-man (commander, gunner, and loader) turret crews of German Panzer III and Panzer IV tanks.

Nicknamed ''[[pirozhok]]'' (stuffed bun) because of its characteristic shape, it was heavy and hard to open. The complaints of the crews urged the design group led by Alexander Morozov to switch in August 1942&lt;ref&gt;http://english.battlefield.ru/t-34.html&lt;/ref&gt; to using two hatches in the turret.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Drabkin|Drabkin &amp; Sheremet 2006:27-28]]&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\nThe loader also had a difficult job due to the lack of a turret basket (a rotating floor that moves as the turret turns); the same fault was present on all German tanks prior to the Panzer IV. The floor under the T-34's turret was made up of ammunition stored in small metal boxes, covered by a rubber mat. There were nine ready rounds of ammunition stowed in racks on the sides of the fighting compartment. Once these rounds had been used, the crew had to pull additional ammunition out of the floor boxes, leaving the floor littered with open bins and matting and reducing their performance.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Zaloga-1984|Zaloga &amp; Grandsen 1984:137]]&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\n{{quotation|The main weakness [of the two-man turret of a T-34 Model 1941] is that it is very tight.

When in June 1941, the [[8th Mechanised Corps]] of [[D.I. Ryabyshev]] marched towards Dubno, the corps lost half of its vehicles. A.V.

It was the debut of the German [[Panther tank]], although the numbers employed at Kursk were small and the brunt of the burden was carried by the [[Panzer III]], [[Sturmgeschütz III|StuG III]], and [[Panzer IV]]. The campaign featured the largest tank battles in history. The high-water mark of the battle was the massive armour engagement at [[Battle of Prokhorovka|Prokhorovka]], which began on 12 July, though the vast majority of armour losses on both sides were caused by artillery and mines, rather than tanks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prokhorovka Interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zamulin|first1=Valeriy|title=Prokhorovka Interview|url=http://worldoftanks.ru/ru/news/pc-browser/12/prokhorovka_interview_zamulin/?|website=World of Tanks|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 6,000 fully tracked armoured vehicles, 4,000 combat aircraft, and 2 million men are believed to have participated in these battles.<br />\n<br />\nThe Soviet high command's decision to focus on one cost-effective design, cutting costs and simplifying production wherever possible while only allowing relatively minor improvements, had proven to be an astute choice for the first two years of the war. However, the battles in the summer of 1943 demonstrated that the 76.2&amp;nbsp;mm gun of the T-34 was no longer as effective as it was in 1941. Soviet tank crews struggled at longer ranges with the additional frontal armour applied to the later variants of the Panzer III and Panzer IV, and were unable to penetrate the frontal armour of the new German Panther or Tiger I tank at standard combat ranges without tungsten rounds, and had to rely on tactical skill through flanking maneuvers and combined arms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prokhorovka Interview&quot; /&gt;<br />\n<br />\n===T-34-85===<br />\n[[File:P82-2l.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A T-34 Model 1943 (left), next to the [[T-43 medium tank|T-43]].]]<br />\nAfter improved German Panzer IVs with the high-velocity [[7.5 cm KwK 40|75&amp;nbsp;mm (2.95&amp;nbsp;in) gun]] were encountered in combat in 1942, a project to design an entirely new Soviet tank was begun, with the goals of increasing armour protection while adding modern features like a [[torsion-bar]] suspension and a three-man turret. This new tank, the [[T-43 medium tank|T-43]], was intended to be a universal tank to replace both the T-34 and the [[KV-1 (tank)|KV-1]] heavy tank. However, the T-43 prototype's armour, though heavier, was still not proof against German 88&amp;nbsp;mm guns, while its mobility was found to be inferior to the T-34. Finally, although the T-43 shared over 70% of its components with the T-34, manufacturing it would still have required a significant slow-down in production.&lt;ref name=&quot;zaloga1997&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Zaloga-1997|Zaloga et al. 1997:5]]&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the T-43 was cancelled.<br />\n<br />\nNot only were the weapons of German tanks improving, so was their armour. Soviet firing tests against a captured Tiger I heavy tank in April 1943 showed that the T-34's 76&amp;nbsp;mm gun could not penetrate the front of the Tiger I at all, and the side only at the very close range. A Soviet 85&amp;nbsp;mm anti-aircraft gun, the [[85 mm air defense gun M1939 (52-K)|52-K]], was found capable of doing the job, and so derivatives of it were developed for tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eugene Boldyrev |url=http://www.battlefield.ru/content/view/87/43/lang,en/ |title=Средний танк Т-34-85 – The Russian Battlefield |publisher=Battlefield.ru |date=2005-09-20 |accessdate=2010-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Healy 2008:167–171&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting tank gun could penetrate the side armour of the Tiger I from a distance of 800 meters and the turret side from a distance of 600 meters.

Its turret ring was enlarged from 1,425&amp;nbsp;mm (56&amp;nbsp;in) to 1,600&amp;nbsp;mm (63&amp;nbsp;in), allowing a larger turret to be fitted and thus the larger 85&amp;nbsp;mm gun. The prototype T-43's turret design was hurriedly adopted by Vyacheslav Kerichev at the [[Krasnoye Sormovo Factory]] to fit the T-34.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Zaloga-1984|Zaloga &amp; Grandsen 1984:166]]&lt;/ref&gt; This was a larger three-man turret, with radio (previously in the hull) and observation cupola in the roof. Now the tank commander needed only to command (aided by cupola and radio systems), leaving the operation of the gun to the gunner and the loader. The turret armour was much thicker, 90&amp;nbsp;mm, even if bigger and less sloped than the original T-34 turret. This made the turret, overall, a bigger target (due to the three-man crew and bigger gun), but more resistant to enemy fire. The ammunition load shrank from around 90-100 to 55-60 shells, but the projectiles were 50% heavier (9&amp;nbsp;kg) and were much better in the anti-armour role, and reasonable in a general purpose role. The resulting new tank, the T-34-85, was seen as a compromise between advocates for the T-43 and others who wanted to continue to build as many 76&amp;nbsp;mm-armed T-34s as possible without interruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=63|title=T-34/85 – Medium Tank – History, Specs and Pictures – Military Tanks, Vehicles and Artillery|publisher=|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\n[[File:T-34-85 interior Parola Tank Museum.jpg|thumb|Interior of a T-34-85 viewed from the driver's hatch, showing the ammunition boxes on which the loader had to stand in the absence of a turret basket.

In comparison with the T-34-85 program, the Germans instead chose an upgrade path based on the introduction of completely new, expensive, heavier, and more complex tanks, greatly slowing the growth of their tank production and aiding the Soviets in maintaining a substantial numerical superiority in tanks.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Zaloga-1983|Zaloga &amp; Grandsen 1983:37]]&lt;/ref&gt; By May 1944, T-34-85 production had reached 1,200 tanks per month.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Zaloga-1997|Zaloga et al. 1997:6]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the entire war, production figures for all Panther types reached no more than 6,557, and for all Tiger types (including the Tiger I and Tiger II) 2,027.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Philo, &quot;[http://www.taphilo.com/history/WWII/Production-Figures-WWII.shtml Selected Equipment Production Figures World War II]&quot;. at ''Tom Philo Photography'' website, retrieved on July 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Production figures for the T-34-85 alone reached 22,559.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}<br />\n<br />\n===German use of T-34s===<br />\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-277-0836-04, Russland, erbeutete russische T-34 Panzer.jpg|thumb|Captured T-34 Model 1943 tanks pressed into service with the [[Wehrmacht]], January 1944]]<br />\n<br />\nThe German army often employed as much captured [[materiel]] as possible and T-34s were not an exception.

Red Army combined-arms forces achieved complete surprise and used a powerful, deep-penetrating attack in a classic double encirclement pattern, spearheaded by the T-34-85. The opposing Japanese forces had been reduced as elite units had been drawn off to other fronts and the remaining forces were in the middle of a redeployment. The Japanese tanks remaining to face them were all held in the rear and not used in combat; the Japanese had weak support from [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force|IJAAF]] forces, engineering, and communications. Japanese forces were overwhelmed, though some put up resistance.

To many in Prague, the tank was also a reminder of the Soviet invasion which ended the [[Prague Spring]] of 1968. The tank was painted pink by artist [[David Černý]] in 1991. Following an official protest from the Russian government, the arrest of Černý, a coat of official green paint, public demonstrations, and a further coat of pink paint applied by fifteen parliamentary deputies, the tank was finally removed to a military museum.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Wright-2001|Wright 2001:379]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Zaloga-1996|Zaloga &amp; Kinnear 1996:42–43]]&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\n''Four Tankers and a Dog'' (''[[Czterej pancerni i pies]]''), a very successful war-themed [[Telewizja Polska|Polish television series]] of the 1960s, adapted the novel of the same name by the [[Polish literature|Polish writer]] [[Janusz Przymanowski]] (1922–1998), himself a [[People's Army of Poland]] volunteer.

The identification of T-34 variants can be complicated.

Some Russian historians use different names: they refer to the first T-34 as the ''T-34 Model 1939'' instead of 1940, all T-34s with the original turret and F-34 gun as ''Model 1941'' instead of Models 1941 and 1942, and the [[hexagon]]al-turret T-34 as ''Model 1942'' instead of 1943.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Zheltov-2001|Zheltov 2001, passim]]&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\nGerman [[military intelligence]] in World War II referred to the two main production families as ''T-34/76'' and ''T-34/85'', with subvariants receiving letter designations such as ''T-34/76A'' — this nomenclature has been widely used in the West, especially in popular literature. When the German Wehrmacht used captured T-34s, it designated them ''Panzerkampfwagen T-34(r)'', where the &quot;r&quot; stood for ''russisch'' (&quot;Russian&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers, Bob.

Rails is a [[model–view–controller]] (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a [[database]], a [[web service]], and [[web page]]s. It encourages and facilitates the use of [[web standards]] such as [[JSON]] or [[XML]] for data transfer, [[HTML]], [[CSS]] and [[JavaScript]] for user interfacing. In addition to MVC, Rails emphasizes the use of other well-known [[software engineering]] [[software design pattern|patterns]] and paradigms, including [[convention over configuration]] (CoC), [[don't repeat yourself]] (DRY), and the [[active record pattern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Getting Started with Rails: What Is Rails?|url=http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#what-is-rails-questionmark|website=Ruby on Rails Guides|accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\nRuby on Rails' emergence in the 2000s greatly influenced web app development, through innovative features such as seamless database table creations, migrations, and [[Scaffold (programming)|scaffolding]] of views to enable rapid application development.  Ruby on Rails' influence on other web frameworks remains apparent today, with many frameworks in other languages borrowing its ideas, including [[Django (web framework)|Django]] in [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Catalyst (software)|Catalyst]] in [[Perl]], [[Laravel]] in [[PHP]], [[Phoenix (web framework)|Phoenix]] in [[Elixir (programming language)|Elixir]], and [[Sails.js]] in [[Node.js]].<br />\n<br />\n==History==<br />\n[[David Heinemeier Hansson]] extracted Ruby on Rails from his work on the project management tool [[Basecamp Classic|Basecamp]] at the [[web application]] company also called [[Basecamp (company)|Basecamp]].&lt;ref name=&quot;interview-davidhh&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Lenz−− |last=Grimmer |date=February 2006 |title=Interview with David Heinemeier Hansson from Ruby on Rails |url=http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/interviews/david-heinemeier-hansson-rails.html |publisher=[[MySQL AB]] |accessdate=2008-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225091835/http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/interviews/david-heinemeier-hansson-rails.html |archivedate=February 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\nHansson first released Rails as open source in July 2004, but did not share [[Commit (data management)|commit]] rights to the project until February 2005. {{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} In August 2006, the framework reached a milestone when [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] announced that it would ship Ruby on Rails with [[Mac OS X Leopard|Mac OS X v10.5 &quot;Leopard&quot;]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web<br />\n  | url = http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2006/8/7/ruby-on-rails-will-ship-with-os-x-10-5-leopard<br />\n  | title = Ruby on Rails will ship with OS X 10.5 (Leopard)<br />\n  | accessdate = 2008-06-08<br />\n  | last = Hansson<br />\n  | first = David<br />\n  | date = August 7, 2006<br />\n}}&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\nwhich was released in October 2007.<br />\n<br />\nRails version 2.3 was released on March 15, 2009, with major new developments in templates, engines, [[Rack (web server interface)|Rack]] and nested model forms.

For example, a model class ''User'' will usually be defined in the file 'user.rb' in the app/models directory, and linked to the table 'users' in the database. While developers are free to ignore this convention and choose differing names for their models, files, and database table, this is not common practice and is usually discouraged in accordance with the &quot;convention-over-configuration&quot; philosophy.<br />\n<br />\nA ''controller'' is a server-side component of Rails that responds to external requests from the web server to the application, by determining which view file to render. The controller may also have to query one or more models for information and pass these on to the view. For example, in an airline reservation system, a controller implementing a flight-search function would need to query a model representing individual flights to find flights matching the search, and might also need to query models representing airports and airlines to find related secondary data. The controller might then pass some subset of the flight data to the corresponding view, which would contain a mixture of static HTML and logic that use the flight data to create an HTML document containing a table with one row per flight. A controller may provide one or more actions. In Ruby on Rails, an action is typically a basic unit that describes how to respond to a specific external web-browser request. Also, note that the controller/action will be accessible for external web requests only if a corresponding route is mapped to it. Rails encourages developers to use [[Representational state transfer|REST]]ful routes, which include actions such as create, new, edit, update, destroy, show, and index. These mappings of incoming requests/routes to controller actions can be easily set up in the routes.rb configuration file.<br />\n<br />\nA ''view'' in the default configuration of Rails is an [[ERB-Templating|erb]] file, which is evaluated and converted to [[HTML]] at run-time. Alternatively, many other templating systems can be used for views.<br />\n<br />\nRuby on Rails includes tools that make common development tasks easier &quot;out-of-the-box&quot;, such as [[Scaffold (programming)|scaffolding]] that can automatically construct some of the models and views needed for a basic [[website]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sean Lynch |url=http://fairleads.blogspot.com/2007/12/rails-20-and-scaffolding-step-by-step.html |title=fairleads: Rails 2.0 and Scaffolding Step by Step |website=Fairleads.blogspot.com |date=2007-12-15 |accessdate=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also included are [[WEBrick]], a simple Ruby web server that is distributed with Ruby, and [[Rake (software)|Rake]], a build system, distributed as a [[RubyGems|gem]]. Together with Ruby on Rails, these tools provide a basic development environment.<br />\n<br />\nRuby on Rails is most commonly not connected to the Internet directly, but through some front-end [[web server]]. [[Mongrel (web server)|Mongrel]] was generally preferred{{By whom|date=February 2015}} over WEBrick in the early days,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} but it can also run on [[Lighttpd]], [[Apache (web server)|Apache]], [[Cherokee (Webserver)|Cherokee]], [[Hiawatha (web server)|Hiawatha]], [[Nginx]] (either as a module – [[Phusion Passenger]] for example – or via [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]], [[FastCGI]] or [[mod_ruby]]), and many others.

Ruby on Rails 3.0 uses a technique called [[Unobtrusive JavaScript]] to separate the functionality (or logic) from the structure of the web page. jQuery is fully supported as a replacement for Prototype and is the default JavaScript library in Rails 3.1, reflecting an industry-wide move towards jQuery.

Earlier Rails supported plugins within their own custom framework; version 3.2 deprecates these in favor of standard Ruby &quot;gems&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rails 3.2.0.rc2 has been released!&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date=2012-09-01|title=Rails 3.2.0.rc2 has been released!|url=http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2012/1/4/rails-3-2-0-rc2-has-been-released/|website=Weblog.rubyonrails.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\n===Deployment===<br />\nRuby on Rails is often installed using [[RubyGems]], a package manager&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rubyonrails.org/download|title=Ruby on Rails: Download|publisher=RubyonRails.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212173926/http://rubyonrails.org/download|archivedate=2009-12-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is included with current versions of Ruby. Many free [[Unix-like system]]s also support installation of Ruby on Rails and its dependencies through their native [[package management system]].<br />\n<br />\nRuby on Rails is typically deployed with a database server such as [[MySQL]] or [[PostgreSQL]], and a web server such as [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] running the [[Phusion Passenger]] module.<br />\n<br />\n==Philosophy and design==<br />\nRuby on Rails is intended to emphasize ''[[Convention over Configuration]]'' (CoC), and the ''[[Don't Repeat Yourself]]'' (DRY) principle.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Convention over Configuration&quot; means a developer only needs to specify unconventional aspects of the application. For example, if there is a class ''Sale'' in the model, the corresponding table in the database is called ''sales'' by default. It is only if one deviates from this convention, such as calling the table &quot;products sold&quot;, that the developer needs to write code regarding these names. Generally, Ruby on Rails conventions lead to less code and less repetition.&lt;ref&gt;<br />\n  {{cite web<br />\n  | url = http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html<br />\n  | title = Getting Started with Rails<br />\n  | publisher = Rubyonrails.org<br />\n  | accessdate = 2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Don't repeat yourself&quot; means that information is located in a single, unambiguous place. For example, using the [[Active record pattern|ActiveRecord]] module of Rails, the developer does not need to specify database column names in class definitions. Instead, Ruby on Rails can retrieve this information from the database based on the class name.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Fat models, skinny controllers&quot; means that most of the application logic should be placed within the model while leaving the controller as light as possible.<br />\n<br />\n==Trademarks==<br />\nIn March 2007, [[David Heinemeier Hansson]] filed three Ruby on Rails-related [[trademark]] applications to the [[USPTO]]. These applications regard the phrase &quot;RUBY ON RAILS&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Trademark 77119206&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = &quot;Ruby on Rails&quot; Trademark Status | url = http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=77119206 | publisher = [[USPTO]] | accessdate = 2007-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the word &quot;RAILS&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Trademark 77119210&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = &quot;Rails&quot; Trademark Status | url = http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=77119210 | publisher = [[USPTO]] | accessdate = 2007-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the official Rails logo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trademark 77119208&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Rails Logo Trademark Status | url = http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=77119208 | publisher = [[USPTO]] | accessdate = 2007-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, in the summer of 2007, Hansson denied permission to [[Apress]] to use the Ruby on Rails logo on the cover of a new Ruby on Rails book written by some authoritative community members.
