# Gregology

A simple Jekyll blog for [Gregology.net](http://gregology.net).

## Theme
Base theme Carte Noire created by [@_jacobtomlinson](http://www.twitter.com/_jacobtomlinson).

## Includes
[_includes](https://github.com/gregology/gregology.github.io/tree/master/_includes) contains tools for instagram, youtube, flickr, and generic video players. I have tried to make them as generic as possible with usage examples so they can be used elsewhere. I'm working on my javascript / jekyll skills so please let me know of any improvements.

## License
The jekyll theme, HTML, CSS and JavaScript is licensed under GPLv3 (unless stated otherwise in the file).
