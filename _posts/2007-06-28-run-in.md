I had a bit of a run in with my new arch enemy Angie yesterday. She is a my way or the highway kind of girl but because of that, i end up doing more work (she makes me file in between her work which takes a lot longer than if we did it together). So i went to articulate a possible solution but by the 5th word of my idea she got narkie and went on a 5 minute spiel about how she doesn&#8217;t want to file with me and every time i tried to explain my point she raised her voice. So i stood there in an open plan office been yelled at by a crazy lady. Everyone averted their eyes uncomfortably and I walked away a little shocked and did my filing by myself. A little later Kate came up to me and told me that she shouldn&#8217;t be speaking to me like that and that she&#8217;d informed Angie and my boss, Anne. Later Anne came up and asked how i was going. I think there was an episode of Dilbert like this.
