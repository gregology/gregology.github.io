    I'm back from my little trip :) My little scooter looked pretty lonely while I was away and I want him to feel important and loved again so I've put him up on Gumtree to try and swap him for an art work or a funky teapot.

I&#8217;ll make my decision by the end of this super long weekend and hopefully have a funky artwork to share with you soon <img src="http://gregology.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

So far I&#8217;ve had a half a dozen offers including an interesting painting of Lieyton Hewitt with &#8220;Tennis Pox&#8221;, some antique flower paintings, and a silver tea service set.
