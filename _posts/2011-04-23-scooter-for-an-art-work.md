I'm back from my little trip :) My little scooter looked pretty lonely while I was away and I want him to feel important and loved again so I've put him up on Gumtree to try and swap him for an art work or a funky teapot.<table WIDTH=100%> <tr VALIGN=TOP> <td WIDTH=33% STYLE="border: none; padding: 0cm"> <p ALIGN=CENTER>

I'll make my decision by the end of this super long weekend and hopefully have a funky artwork to share with you soon :)

So far I've had a half a dozen offers including an interesting painting of Lieyton Hewitt with "Tennis Pox", some antique flower paintings, and a silver tea service set.
