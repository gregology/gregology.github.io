I&#8217;m still on night shift, it&#8217;s 4 am and I have a fitness test in 2 hours. I haven&#8217;t done much cardio since I arrived so I&#8217;m a little worried about the run. I&#8217;m watching Bond and I just finished uploading my blog from my trip to Europe in 2007, I&#8217;ve been really slack. My brain isn&#8217;t really working so I&#8217;ll sign off here and try again later.
