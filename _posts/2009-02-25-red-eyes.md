I'm still on night shift, it's 4 am and I have a fitness test in 2 hours. I haven't done much cardio since I arrived so I'm a little worried about the run. I'm watching Bond and I just finished uploading my blog from my trip to Europe in 2007, I've been really slack. My brain isn't really working so I'll sign off here and try again later.
