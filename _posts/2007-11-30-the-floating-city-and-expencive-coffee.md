After swimming through the Milano smog we found the floating city of Venice. It was expensive, smelly, and poorly maintained. After miles of tacky shop lined lanes we found the square. We coffeed (4.8e espresso but it was on my life to do list), pizzaed, then escaped the endless shopping arcade as quick as we could.
