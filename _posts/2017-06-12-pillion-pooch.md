My brother and his wife have been riding around the world on motorbikes collecting dogs, you can checkout their [blog here](https://www.thepacktrack.com/blogs/dog-blog).

In order to safely collect dogs they created a dog carrier specifically for motorbikes called the Pillion Pooch. It's been well tested and I know their dogs love it. Now they've just started a [kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thepacktrack/pillion-pooch-0) to put the wind in more dog's faces. I think it's a great idea and I can't wait to see a random biker exploring the highways with their dog using this product.
