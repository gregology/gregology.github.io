I've made it to Ireland. Last night we hit the piss in an Irish themed pub, there are heaps of them here! I haddn't seen chris, scott, and jacqui for about 6 months so we had some drinking up to do. it was quite expensive at the pub so we bought some nasty cheap beer and continued at home.

I'm using my French phone number again so if you want to contact me +33 (0)615 629 198
