Today I met Kay, my dads cousin, her husband, bob, one of their daughters, kathy, and kathy's son, george, who is 2. This helped me piece some of my family tree together :) kathy took me to a pub in search of work and beer. I didn't get a job but i got a little tipsy :) once i was a little tipsy i asked her how i was related to the people i was currently staying with. She filled me in with lots of details and we shared some family secrets. It was nice to speak to her, i really didn't expect to feel some welcome on my dads side of the family because of the stories he told me about his parents but it was a pleasant surprise to feel so warm with strangers that share only a small amount of blood with me. I've got a big day tomorrow so i'll cut it short. Good night.
