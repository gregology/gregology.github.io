I didn't get home until after 9pm yesterday :( the whole trip from Swanage to Dunstable took over 6 hours because of train delays due to a fatality at Luton Station, but don't worry, it wasn't me :) After checking my email etc I didn't get to sleep until late last night so I was tired this morning. One extra strong mocha later and I was wide eyes open, pounding my keyboard into my desk. My extra energy was focused into my bouncing right leg until the lady opposite, Pat, remarked 'Can anyone feel that, my computer is shaking'. I quickly stopped but the caffeine had hold. Minutes later my leg was off again. My leg stopped and started all day, confusing Pat until I couldn't handle the guilt any more and admitted that the shaking wasn't just in her head, and that in fact it had been me :( The up side of this caffeine trip was that I got through twice as much work as I usually do :) But I don't want them to get used to it so I'll give the mocha a miss tomorrow.

Now for some photos :)
