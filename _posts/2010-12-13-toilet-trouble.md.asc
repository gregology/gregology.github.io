I'm sitting on the toilet completing this entry with a lot of fluid leaving my behind. In the background I can hear an Apache firing rounds and missiles. It feels pretty wary. We've had a few rocket attacks so far, nothing too close but I'm sure they'll get closer as I get older :) We arrived in country after a 20 hour stop over in the UAE. As we got off the C17 there was an Apache hovering above firing. It felt like the right place.

I left a girl behind in Sydney. Dee works at Macquarie uni and I met her playing ultimate frisbee. We're pretty similar in lots of ways, we're both pretty scared of commitment and how it changes us. I'm not sure I ever want to get married, I've got so much still left to do and I'm scared that I won't be able to do it if I'm in a committed relationship. We both felt this way and we entered our relationship knowing that when I left for this deployment that we would break up. That isn't how I framed it with the boys and they are having fun at my expense regarding my decision.
