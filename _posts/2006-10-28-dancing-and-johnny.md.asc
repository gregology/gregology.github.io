I think I'll do my part :) Johnny is a Dick!

I'm nervous, I've got my ball tonight : I'll be performing my routine in front of 600 people. That's 1200 eye's. Well from my research approximately 3% of the population are blind or visually impaired which makes me feel a little better, that would bring it down to 1164 eyes but I'm not sure why blind people would come to watch a dance routine. I hope I don't trip Connie (my dance partner) over during it :( There will be a DVD so I can show anyone interested.
