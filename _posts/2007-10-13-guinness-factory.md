Chris, Scott, and I visited the Guinness factory with 3 of Chris' backpacker mates yesterday. We drank a lot of black and then hit up a crepe bar. The Guinness factory was pretty cool, it cost 14e and we got at least 3 pints so it was a really good deal, plus now I know how they make barrels.

Today was Jacquis birthday so we made chicken burgers and lamingtons. Jacqui cleaned the kitchen because we're boys and don't do that kind of stuff.

We're heading off tomorrow around Ireland if we can get a car so I will be out of blog range for about 2 weeks.
