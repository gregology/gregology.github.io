Self experimentation helps me become the best version of me. Declaring my experiments before seeing the results keeps me honest. This is the second of many planned self experiments.

### Cannabinoid effect on Sleep

**Hypothesis**

Low dose Cannabidiol (CBD) & Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) taken orally before bed will increase sleep quality as measured by a Mi Bank 3 using the Mi Fit sleep points metric.

**Experiment**

The experiment will be separated into 3 day experiment blocks and 3 day control blocks. The subject will take 10mg CBD & 10mg THC via 2 capsules prior to bed on experiment days. No other cannabis products will be consumed during the experiment period. The subject will wear a Mi Band 3 and use the Mi Fit app to track sleep quality.

The experiment will start on the 5th of June and run for 42 days. 42 day experiment length addresses weekly seasonality with 3 day experiment blocks. The [results & calculations](https://github.com/memair/experiments/blob/master/2019-06-05%20Cannabinoid%20effect%20on%20Sleep.ipynb) will be published on GitHub.

I welcome any feedback, comments, or advice on experiment design. Make a prediction in the comments below!
