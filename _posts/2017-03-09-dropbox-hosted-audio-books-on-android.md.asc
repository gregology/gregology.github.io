My ears get bored on busses so I consume a lot of audiobooks. Dropbox is my main backup solution and it contains the majority of my collection. I wanted an easy way to consume those audiobooks on my Android device. This is what I did;

![Downloaded Smart AudioBook Player](/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017-03-09 22.36.30.png "Downloaded Smart AudioBook Player"){:height="45%" width="45%"}

Install [Smart AudioBook Player](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ak.alizandro.smartaudiobookplayer), it's free, has no ads, and is available in the Play Store

![Audiobooks Dropbox Directory](/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017-03-09 22.27.29.png "Audiobooks Dropbox Directory"){:height="45%" width="45%"}

Create an *Audiobooks* directory in Dropbox and store your books in separate subdirectories

![AudioBook Available Offline on Dropbox](/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017-03-09 22.27.35.png "AudioBook Available Offline on Dropbox"){:height="45%" width="45%"}

Make the directory of the book or books you are currently listening to *Available Offline*. You can also optionally make the whole Audiobooks directory *Available Offline* however that may take up a lot of space on your device

![Set Dropbox data directory as root folder](/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017-03-09 22.58.04.png "Set Dropbox data directory as root folder"){:height="45%" width="45%"}

In the library settings of Smart AudioBook Player, select the Dropbox data directory as the root folder. The location may be different on your device/version of Android. On my device it was

```
/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.dropbox.android/files/[user_id]/scratch/Audiobooks
```

Checkout [this](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/8436/dropbox-for-android-folder-location) stackexchange post for hints as to where it lives on your particular device

![Hit refresh in Smart AudioBook Players Library](/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017-03-09 22.27.08.png "Hit refresh in Smart AudioBook Players Library"){:height="45%" width="45%"}

Hit refresh in Smart AudioBook Players Library. The books that are currently stored offline should appear

![Enjoy your Dropbox hosted Audiobooks on your Android device](/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017-03-09 22.28.43.png "Enjoy your Dropbox hosted Audiobooks on your Android device"){:height="45%" width="45%"}

Select your book...

![Enjoy your bus ride](/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bus-ride.gif "Enjoy your bus ride"){:height="50%" width="50%"}

And enjoy your trip with Dropbox hosted Audiobooks on your Android Device!
