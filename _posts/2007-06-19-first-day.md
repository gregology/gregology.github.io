I had my first working day in 3 months today. I put invoices into a spreadsheet. It&#8217;s pretty boring but the company seems to have good promotion opportunities. I get an hour for lunch making it a 35 hour week. There is a gym close to my work but it&#8217;s incredibly expensive, Â£65 a month, that&#8217;s $2k a year in gods currency, so i think i&#8217;ll give that a miss. Well i&#8217;ve got a contract to fill out <img src="/wp-content/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
