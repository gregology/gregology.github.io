I had my first working day in 3 months today. I put invoices into a spreadsheet. It's pretty boring but the company seems to have good promotion opportunities. I get an hour for lunch making it a 35 hour week. There is a gym close to my work but it's incredibly expensive, Â£65 a month, that's $2k a year in gods currency, so i think i'll give that a miss. Well i've got a contract to fill out :)
