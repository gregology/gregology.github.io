I've decided to head back to GÃ¶teborg tonight as there were no trains to Stockholm. I had a wonder around the city but was limited by my pack. The train ride here was awesome, lots of beautiful lakes but now the sun is sleeping so I'll get the stars on my return. This is the furthest north I've been and I'm feeling it. My hands are numb.
