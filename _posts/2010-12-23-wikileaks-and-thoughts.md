This year has been the deadliest for coalition forces in Afghanistan. Ten Australian soldiers and over 700 coalition forces have died here. While I've been here Wikileaks has been releasing more government documents and this hasn't gone down well here. It has the possibility of making life more dangerous for deployed Aussie diggers but it raises an interesting point, who owns secret government documents? If the people own the government and the government owns the documents, then the people own the documents. It has been a really interesting insight into international politics and assumed ownership of information. Governments are themselves becoming more open with their data with initiative such as the UK's National Archive. I think this decade is going to be to information what love was to the 60's.
