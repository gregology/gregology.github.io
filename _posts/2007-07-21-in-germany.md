I'm in Germany :) So far so good. I'm blogging from my phone because my GPS PDA is loosing battery and it's my way to the hostel. I sat next to a German who works for Macquarie Bank and an English woman who sleeps with her mouth open. I spoke my first German words in Germany when I came through customs, I said 'bitter'. I was very chuffed with myself. The only other German words I know are from Rammstein songs so I'm not sure what kind of friends I'll make here. I've just gotten on a fancy tram. I haven't got a ticket but I'll play the 'I'm Australian' card and give them a smile, and if that fails I'll pull some Rammstein lyrics and they'll think I'm manically depressed and leave me alone.
