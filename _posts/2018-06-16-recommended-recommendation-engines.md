Recommendation Engines predict a users preference in order to maximize some goal. Consider YouTube's watch next auto play feature which does an amazing job at suggesting relevant videos for users. It's unlikely that the users goals align with the YouTube goals. YouTube's recommendation engine is tuned to increase ad revenue. However a users goals might be to get more sleep or finish an assignment.

Recommendation Engines are amazing at what they do but they are not designed for the user.
