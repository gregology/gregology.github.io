[Trampoline Day][1] is a self organised event and today was the first time the event had been held in Sydney. It is a two way dialogue where anyone who wishes gets an opportunity to run a talk. Mine was on Open Source and I&#8217;ll upload the YouTube video shortly. Here are my notes from today.

**Peerfunding** with Tom from [StartSomeGood][3] @tomjd  
Tax benifits do not matter for crowd funding  
Emotional not tax benifits as reason for donations  
Crowd funding is peerfunding, a community not anonymous people  
Kick starter is not a crowd of people who like giving away money. Funds go to community products. Start with friends and your community.  
Know the names of your first 5 supporters  
You never see an empty tip jar  
Investment, have something you want, want to give, want you to succeed  
Kick starter is not a community, it is a tool.  
Ask for help.
