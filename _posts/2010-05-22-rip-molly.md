I found out today that Molly was put down yesterday. I loved that dog. I wasn&#8217;t going to see her again but for some reason it&#8217;s harder to deal with knowing that she&#8217;s not existing atm even though she was never going to exist in my life. I know that might sound self centred but she wasn&#8217;t self aware and wasn&#8217;t scared of non existence so her death isn&#8217;t bad for her. Maybe I&#8217;m just trying to deal with her death <img src="/wp-content/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> She failed the tests they do to see if they can rehouse her. Stu said he would take her and find a home for her but by the time mum contacted the RSPCA today it was too late <img src="/wp-content/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> My mum said to me today &#8220;Do you think she&#8217;s getting on well with Lulu?&#8221; I wanted to believe that but I couldn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s strange that people are only willing to accept non existence in 3 dimensions of the 4 common dimensions.
