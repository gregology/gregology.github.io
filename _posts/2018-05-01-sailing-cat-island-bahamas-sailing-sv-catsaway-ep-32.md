This week we relax and explore Cat Island.

We anchored outside of Rolleezz Resort.  Carl and Yvonne are very welcoming to cruisers and encouraged us to hang out at the resort and use the facilities.  We borrowed a couple of bikes and headed into Old Bight.  Cat Island has a lot of history; many plantations were established here.  The church in Old Bight is still in service and was the first church for freed slaves in the Bahamas.

The next stop was New Bight and there was a lot to explore.  We visited The Hermitage, a medieval style monastery hand built by Father Jerome.  The ruins of a great plantation house also remain.  We treked the 2 miles to the windward side in search of sea beans (we didn't find any) and sea glass (we found a lot!).  There is a lot of garbage on the windward beaches, but the Bahamas is doing something about it - they are banning the use of single use plastics and styrofoam by 2020.

After New Bight, we made the jump to Orange Creek.  The reefs around Orange Creek are spectacular - we could see the colour from the waters surface!  It felt rejuvenating to be around this much live coral and sealife; we realize now that many reefs we have visited are in the process of being bleached.  The documentary Chasing Coral is a good explanation on why this is happening.  www.chasingcoral.com

Greg finally speared his first lobster on the last day of lobster season!

We spent the evening in Arthur Town, enjoying the Cat Island Humane Society Benefit.  Thanks to all our friends there for their assistance in our cat emergency last episode.
