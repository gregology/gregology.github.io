Recently I moved to the Kings Cross area and have noticed a big difference in the quality of coffee so I&#8217;ve started rating the shops on coffee quality alone (my drink of choice is a latte with honey on the side). Then I pushed the info into a Google Map that you can access from your mobile by [clicking here][1] or if technology doesn&#8217;t fail me, it should appear embedded below. Green is good (4 or 5), yellow is alright (3), and red isn&#8217;t great (1 or 2).
