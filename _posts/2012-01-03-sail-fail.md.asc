We're at the Basin which is about 2km north of our starting location. It's a lovely place but I think the Australian land mass us moving north faster then us. The winds weren't favourable and the East Australian Current (the underwater highway in Finding Nemo) wanted to go south. After a trip to the 360 degree liquid horizon we had only traveled only 5 were north and the crew were mostly green. With this in mind the decision was made to cut our losses and wait for the winds to agree with our travel plans.

It definitely could be worse :)
