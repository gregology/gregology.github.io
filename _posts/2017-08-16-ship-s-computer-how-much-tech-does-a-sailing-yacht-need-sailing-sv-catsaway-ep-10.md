Catsaway is for sale - https://SVCatsaway.com/forsale
Live map - https://SVCatsaway.com/map

We updated the ship’s technology including;
 - Raspberry Pi running a Rails app as the Ship’s Computer
 - Outernet receiver for weather at sea
 - Find me Spot to report ships current location
 - vYacht to connect to the Ship’s instruments
 - And an EPIRB in case of emergency

We attempted to create our own Seatalk cable in order to save some money. It worked for a little while but was constantly causing instrument errors when the boat moved. Diana and I are trekkies aso it was fun working on a Star Trek themed Ship’s Computer. I’ll enjoy continuing to work on that while we’re sailing at warp 0.00000000000001.
