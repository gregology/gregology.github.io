"Multigrain bagel with tofu" was just called in this deliberately rustic looking [café][1] in Queens. The staff wear fedoras and the customers wear Lulu Lemon while pushing little people cars or typing on MacBooks.  There are a lot more smiles, laughs and in jokes here then the cafés I found in Manhattan. This was the kind of cultural experience I wanted from my trip to NYC, I feel like I could become a local here. Plus they serve decent coffee including cold pressed! My indecisiveness pushed me further out of town as the cheap hostels booked up. It worked out really well and I ended up next door to a 50s style diner. I ate all kinds of awful foods which will help me appreciate American movies.

Pecan Pie was Trip Tucker's (Star Trek Enterprise) favourite dish and I wanted to experience it.

TV lied to me about Manhattan and I didn't realise it wasn't finished yet. The streets were full of litter  and the buildings were run down or under construction. The people were interesting and it was easy to start a conversation, get a direction, or exchange a smile. By my second day exploring the island the tourist bus salesmen had stopped hassling me so I must have looked somewhat local.

I'm going to sit back and people watch, here are some pictures.
