I just said goodbye to Ninny :'( That's the last I'll see of my family for a while. I'm off to Perth tomorrow then leaving for London on the 4th of April with my girlfriend Nathalie. I want to learn comedy in another language so I might be away for a while. It has been nice spending time with Ninny and Gerard before I go. Except Ninny took us out to a restaurant and failed to inform me that it was a vegetarian restaurant, so when I asked if the feta pasta salad had meat in it I was answered with a really slow "... This is a vegetarian restaurant"

I'm having coffee with an army mate now, Ninny and Gerard are at a wedding.
