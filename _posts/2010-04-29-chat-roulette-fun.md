[Chat Roulette][1] is a webcam chat site that matches you with a stranger. 25% of the time, the stranger is a guys waistÂ but most of the time you get a face. I was getting bored with that so I decided to have a little bit of fun. I installed a virtual webcam ([Webcam Studio][2]) and downloaded webcam videos made by children on YouTube. Here are the results

This guy asked if I was a virgin&#8230;

At least this guy kept his underwear on

I had about 20 funny screenshots but only these 2 were appropriate for my blog. Most of the time it was a disgusted/concerned face that quickly hit the next button <img src="/wp-content/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
