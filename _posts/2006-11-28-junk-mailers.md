Today I came across a junk mail delivery fellow. We made pleasantries as we both stuffed papers into the a massive unit blocks mail boxes. On face value we were doing the same job but clearly not. I could see in his eyes that the pleasantries we made were only face value. I don’t understand why, he smelt like BO and didn’t even have a motorbike!

Auspost is giving us a nice BBQ set for Christmas <img src="http://gregology.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I noticed that the set didn’t have a knife. I don’t think they trust 150 posties with knives after a long pre Christmas work day.
