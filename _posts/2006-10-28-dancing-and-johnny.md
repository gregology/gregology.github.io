"Freedom of expression online is a right, not a privilege - but it's a right that needs defending," said Steve Ballinger of Amnesty International. "We're asking bloggers worldwide to show their solidarity with web users in countries where they can face jail just for criticising the government."

I think I'll do my part :) Johnny is a Dick!

I'm nervous, I've got my ball tonight : I'll be performing my routine in front of 600 people. That's 1200 eye's. Well from my research approximately 3% of the population are blind or visually impaired which makes me feel a little better, that would bring it down to 1164 eyes but I'm not sure why blind people would come to watch a dance routine. I hope I don't trip Connie (my dance partner) over during it :( There will be a DVD so I can show anyone interested.
