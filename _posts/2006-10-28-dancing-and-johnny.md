&#8220;Freedom of expression online is a right, not a privilege &#8211; but it&#8217;s a right that needs defending,&#8221; said Steve Ballinger of Amnesty International. &#8220;We&#8217;re asking bloggers worldwide to show their solidarity with web users in countries where they can face jail just for criticising the government.&#8221;

I think I’ll do my part <img src="http://gregology.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Johnny is a Dick!

I’m nervous, I’ve got my ball tonight : I’ll be performing my routine in front of 600 people. That’s 1200 eye’s. Well from my research approximately 3% of the population are blind or visually impaired which makes me feel a little better, that would bring it down to 1164 eyes but I’m not sure why blind people would come to watch a dance routine. I hope I don’t trip Connie (my dance partner) over during it <img src="http://gregology.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> There will be a DVD so I can show anyone interested.
