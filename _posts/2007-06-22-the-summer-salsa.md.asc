It's still light outside on this, the day of summer salsa. I went swimming with haley and liz. I don't have goggles so my eyes hurt. Office work is nothing like the tv show. I type numbers into a screen then click a button, then type more numbers. It's quite boring but the company seems like a good company to work for because they have free hot chocolate.

Today Trudy asked if i'd met Angie, i'd met a lot of people in my first 4 days of work and this Angie wasn't important enough to remember so Trudy introduced us again to which Angie replied "yes, we met yesterday". I smiled and looked at Trudy like she was a fool for re-introducing us.

Well it's late and i've got dress down day tomorrow, I feel just like Dilbert!
