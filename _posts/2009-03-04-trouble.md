I was playing radio and I introduced some ratel (radio telephone procedure) I picked up from Generation Kill, an american TV series about troops invading Iraq. The watch keeper wasn't impressed but I was speaking to Buzz on the other end and I know he loves that show so he got what I was putting down.
