I'm back in Dunstable. The plane was delayed, I don't think I've been on an easy jet flight that hasn't been delayed. A taxi driver at the air port tried to charge me 40 quid, or $100 in gods currency, for a 10 minute ride, so I took a free shuttle bus to the train station and got a 10 quid taxi there :)
