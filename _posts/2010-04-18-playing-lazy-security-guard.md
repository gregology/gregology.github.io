Have you ever wanted to play lazy arse security guard? The kind that doesn't even leave his chair? By googling *inurl:"viewerframe?mode=motion"* you can! *"viewerframe?mode=motion"* is used in the urls of a massive amount of controllable webcams and the *inurl:* query searches for urls which contain it. Google, science bless it, has found a lot of them. Here are my favourites:

[South Club Marina][1] - You can watch the sunrise at a reasonable hour and zoom in on peoples boats.

[Some Loch][2] - I'm pretty sure this is some sort of loch, I've seen trams in the back ground too.

[Pretty cityscape][3] - I'm not sure where this is but it's kind of pretty at night, this camera has crazy zooming abilities.

If you find any other cool ones, drop me a line :)
