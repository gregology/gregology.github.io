populations getting their own news is nothing new

News stories written for algorithims not humans

infinate scrolling, rubbish content until something comes up

people don't understand how easy miss information is to generate, education is an rc
"scientists believe" headlines completly miss the point of science

Groups are finally learning to successfully organise online with good and bad consequences, capitol riots & r/wallstreetbets

challenging people's ideas isn't profitable
