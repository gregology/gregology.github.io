I just finished an interview at kathy's work for a data entry position. The pay is Â£16,000 about 40k in real money, and i've been given a 3 month contract starting monday week. I'm pretty excited about having an office job. Belay that second last comment, i've just been told that i start next monday, that means i can get well sloshed tonight in celebration :) kathy organised it for me and even picked me up for the interview, easiest job hunt ever. I had another interview today for a national insurance number. I had to goto a town called bedford which is an hour and a half bus trip through some really nice english countryside.

Nathalie is living it up in greece but says that the food makes you sick, they should advertise it as a diet holiday.
