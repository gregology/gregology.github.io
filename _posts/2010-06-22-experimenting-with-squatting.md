The toilet stalls at uni have anti squatting signs similar to this one.

At first I thought the idea of squatting on a toilet was silly but I don&#8217;t like blindly obeying signs and I like to try new things so&#8230;

And I&#8217;m glad I did, it is amazing! I have never felt so empty. After a little research I found out that squatting is the [healthier option][3] too. It minimises &#8220;fecal stagnation&#8221; (which just sounds awful) and reduces the risk of colon cancer, colitis, Crohn&#8217;s disease, contamination of the small intestine, diverticulosis, gynecological disorders, heart attacks, hemorrhoids, hiatus hernia and GERD, pregnancy and childbirth issues, prostate disorders, and sexual dysfunction!

Tips for new squatters; aim forward and make sure there is a toilet brush available.

Yet again, not obeying a sign has worked out well for me.
