Recently I spent 3 days baby sitting my 3 year old nephew. I was the substitute teacher of babysitters. Here is a few of the fibs he told me.

He told me we were allowed to wee in the back yard.

[<img title="IMAG0239clean" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMAG0248.jpg" alt="" width="169" height="300" />][2] [<img title="IMAG0239clean" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMAG0252.jpg" alt="" width="100%" height="auto" />][3]

He told me he doesn&#8217;t wear pullups anymore. This was particularly annoying because we were sharing a bed.

And he assured me that he is allowed to sit on the sofa with the dog.

None of these it turns out were true and I started to clue on towards the end. In order to catch the little monkey out I began recording some of our conversations.

I checked with his mother and he does not eat ice cream for lunch every day <img src="/wp-content/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
