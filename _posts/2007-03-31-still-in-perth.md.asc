I'm still in Perth spending time with Natty and her family. We've been spending some time at Nat's Dads place right in the centre of town. It's noisy on a Saturday night and by saying that I feel old. We went dancing the other night, which was pretty cool. I'm getting really excited about travelling over seas now. It's not long at all now. I've got a few pennies saved. I have a few thousand Australian Dollars, 20 British Pounds, 20 New Zealand Dollars (I have no plans on visiting there but I like to be prepared and Gerard doesn't like to pay be back in Australian currency) and 1 Canadian Dollar. To put this in perspective for future readers here are some common benchmarks. The Australian Dollar is worth about 0.80 US Dollars, about 0.60 Euros, bread costs about $1 for a 700g loaf, gold costs $820 per ounce, my one way plane ticket cost $1280, a 2007 Hyundia Getz 3 door auto costs $15,990 ($330 extra for metallic paint), and energy costs as of today are as follows,
