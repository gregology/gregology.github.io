Tonight I'm playing with the Ottawian Ruby crowd at Ruby Tuesday hosted by Shopify. My notes are limited as there was free beer.

First talk - Internationalization by @J3

Internationalization - done once  
localization - done at each location

You should internationalization your code even if your only deploying to one locale

Locales are a mix of geography and language

Don't write magic in your code, magic in programming is processes that you haven't taken the time to understand yet.

Copy should be it's own set. Text "Article was created" = Concept "successful article created"

"A method longer than 8 lines has something wrong"
