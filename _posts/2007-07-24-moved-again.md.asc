I don't think Anne got much work done last week and people must have noticed because I was moved again today. I'm sitting on the other side of the office in Angie's old desk. When I turned on the computer her name appeared in the login window. I felt a chill down my spin and quickly deleted it. I'm sitting next to a new fellow, Scott. After my last experience it took he a while to build up the courage to ask him if he wants to file together but to my surprise he replied softly "OK". 

I start open uni soon. My first course is called Globalisation: The Asia Pacific and Australia through Griffith University. I've never studied by correspondence and I was concerned that I wouldn't have the initiative or will power to do well, but then I realised that at Newcastle University I didn't have the initiative or will power to do well :)
