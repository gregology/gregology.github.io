Putt putt burrâ€¦ and then my bike wouldnâ€™t go anymore :( I looked in the petrol tank and there wasnâ€™t any of that bad tasting water in there :( Iâ€™d turned the fuel switch to reserve earlier on my beat and I forgot about it so putt putt burr. I put the choke on full to get the last bit of fuel out of the lines which got me a few hundred metres but by the time she putt putt burred for the last time I was still half a click from the petrol station. So push push push and sweat sweat sweat and I was home sweet :) I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll forget fuel any time soon.

Tomorrow Iâ€™ve got my big 9 week postie test. If I donâ€™t sort my mail fast enough I donâ€™t get offered a full time job :( The funny thing is they donâ€™t do an accuracy check ðŸ˜‰ so itâ€™ll be sort sort sort, until I find my self lagging, then itâ€™ll be stuff stuff stuff and Pam from Campbell Parade will be reading Sue from Gordon Streetâ€™s mail :) But it doesnâ€™t matter, Pamâ€™s nosey and Sue has dementia and lives in an old folks home.
