I didn&#8217;t get home until after 9pm yesterday <img src="/wp-content/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> the whole trip from Swanage to Dunstable took over 6 hours because of train delays due to a fatality at Luton Station, but don&#8217;t worry, it wasn&#8217;t me <img src="/wp-content/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> After checking my email etc I didn&#8217;t get to sleep until late last night so I was tired this morning. One extra strong mocha later and I was wide eyes open, pounding my keyboard into my desk. My extra energy was focused into my bouncing right leg until the lady opposite, Pat, remarked &#8216;Can anyone feel that, my computer is shaking&#8217;. I quickly stopped but the caffeine had hold. Minutes later my leg was off again. My leg stopped and started all day, confusing Pat until I couldn&#8217;t handle the guilt any more and admitted that the shaking wasn&#8217;t just in her head, and that in fact it had been me <img src="/wp-content/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> The up side of this caffeine trip was that I got through twice as much work as I usually do <img src="/wp-content/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> But I don&#8217;t want them to get used to it so I&#8217;ll give the mocha a miss tomorrow.

Now for some photos <img src="/wp-content/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
