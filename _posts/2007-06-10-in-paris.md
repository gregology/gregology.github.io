We've left cahors and are currently in paris. I saw the tower today and it was a different colour than i expected. There were huge lines so i just admired it from below. I'm off to the uk on tuesday because of a break down in communications between Bob Fillis (the greek guy organising nats teaching job) and nathalie is still heading for greece for her english teaching job then she'll come to the uk once i'm setup :) will write more soon
