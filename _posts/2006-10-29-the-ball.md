The Masquerade Ball went really well last night. I preformed the routine I’d being practicing for 2 months in front of about 600 people. It was such a thrill, and I didn’t even drop Connie! It was awesome dancing in front of all those people. After my performance I danced until my legs hurt then drunk $3 schooners to numb the pain. Getting home was a little bit of a challenge though, being that the UNSW is on the other side of the city. But 2 hours, 2 busses and a taxi later I was home in my warm bed :)
