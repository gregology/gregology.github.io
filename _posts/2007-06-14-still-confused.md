I&#8217;m still no closer to figuring out what relation kath and boyd are to me <img src="http://gregology.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> i&#8217;ll give my mum call and ask her. I bought a sim card today with cheap international rates, so cheap it is actually cheaper for me to call oz then the uk. I also applied for some jobs, one at Windsor Castle, i figure the promotion opportunities there would be pretty good and if i work hard i might get to be the queen of england! I also applied for a job at a pub. I looked into getting benefits but it seems a lot easier to get job then to get benefits, and even when you do it&#8217;s only Â£47 a week, hardly enough to get drunk on in the UK. I really miss centre link <img src="http://gregology.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> i don&#8217;t have the internet at the moment and i&#8217;m getting withdrawals. There are a lot of wifi hot spots around but there all locked <img src="http://gregology.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> kath has noticed i&#8217;ve gotten a little bored and has suggested i go stay with boz who has 3 sons around my age. They live closer to london town so i think i&#8217;ll do that, and boz works at heathrow so he might be able to line me up with some work. maybe they&#8217;ll let me fly the planes or even give people petit bags of really salty nuts and then little cans of coke that wouldn&#8217;t quench the thirst of a drowning mouse who&#8217;s not really thirsty in the first place because he was having a drink before he started drowning. I&#8217;m going to go to the library tomorrow to use the internet to continue my search for work.
