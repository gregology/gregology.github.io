I've left Sydney and am in Newcastle with my sister and new brother in law. My Dad drove me up. I'm no longer a postie and I'm excited about my travels. I don't have to get up at 5 tomorrow so I'm quite happy. My going away party was on friday and I've had a few beers now so I'm a little tipsy. I'm also a little sad about leaving everyone. I'll keep you in touch.
