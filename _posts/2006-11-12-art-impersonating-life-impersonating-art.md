The other day I discovered that male brains don‚Äôt stop maturing until 25. This made me feel so much better. Now I‚Äôve got an excuse for the next year and a half! I‚Äôm still saving up all my money for a trip overseas. A fellow called me the other day regarding a message I left on a forum. He has a ship in Australia and he needs crew for a trip to India! He‚Äôll be leaving early next year so if I can get a berth on that ship I‚Äôll be off <img src="http://gregology.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

I went to Chris‚Äôs last night for his birthday party. They have renovated a lot of their house and I noticed that in the corner of their new toilet they had a replica of Kazimir Malevich‚Äôs, White on white, a suprematist composition. I was very impressed that one, they had this piece of art work and were brave enough to make such a bold statement about suprematism by placing it in their toilet, and two that I‚Äôd remembered something from my art modernism 1010 course. I told Chris‚Äôs mum that I liked the ark work in the toilet. She said ‚Äúthe photo?‚Äù I replied ‚Äúno, that Russian one in the corner.‚Äù She looked at me with a confused look and then she told me to open it, that‚Äôs when I discovered that it was an electrical box <img src="http://gregology.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I felt a little dumb. I took a photo of it so I can prove that they look very similar.

I spent the weekend cleaning my room and getting Nathalie‚Äôs room ready and then did the domestic thing for my mum. Put together some benches, went shopping, and then I re tiled some of the back yard. Now my weekend is nearly over but it‚Äôs alright, I‚Äôll get to see Michael tomorrow. He‚Äôs the fellow that hooked up my part time job. He‚Äôs got pretty eyes and me lets me call him Mike üòâ
