Seven nights was a good start for my exploration of Montréal. I&#8217;ve created a [travel map][1] which will continue to be updated as the city reveals itself. My French came in handy and I ordered most of my meals in a chewed up Australian version of French. For the most part got what I wanted. I was lucky enough to meet some really interesting people, friends of friends of friends etc and also a special lady <img src="/wp-content/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Great dinner/lunch/coffee company and conversation was always easy to find. One night we watched [The Kids Are All Right][2] (IMDB lies, it&#8217;s way better then 7.1) at a new friends home. After the film we spent 15 minutes analysing what we had just watched. During the conversation I remember thinking, this is a wonderful place and I&#8217;m really enjoying my life <img src="/wp-content/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Just for Laughs Gags is an awesome show but now I can&#8217;t take Montréal police seriously. Whenever I saw a cop I would look at them sideways expecting them to do something funny.

There was an audio visual piece at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts about some Canadian [Riots][3] in 2011. I watched the whole thing waiting for the gag. It turns out that 140 people were injured during the riot so I probably shouldn&#8217;t have been staring at the screen with a smile on my face.
