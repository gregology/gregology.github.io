I just finished an interview at kathy&#8217;s work for a data entry position. The pay is Â£16,000 about 40k in real money, and i&#8217;ve been given a 3 month contract starting monday week. I&#8217;m pretty excited about having an office job. Belay that second last comment, i&#8217;ve just been told that i start next monday, that means i can get well sloshed tonight in celebration <img src="http://gregology.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> kathy organised it for me and even picked me up for the interview, easiest job hunt ever. I had another interview today for a national insurance number. I had to goto a town called bedford which is an hour and a half bus trip through some really nice english countryside.
