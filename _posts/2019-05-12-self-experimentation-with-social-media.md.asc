Self experimentation helps me become the best version of me. Declaring my experiments before seeing the results keeps me honest. This is the first of many planned self experiments.

### Social Media's effect on my self reported happiness

**Hypothesis**

Exposure to social media is negatively correlated to self reported happiness.

**Experiment**

I will use [Memair DNS](https://memair.com/dns) on my computer & mobile device to pseudorandomly block social media on 50% of days. Every morning of the experiment, I will self report my happiness on a scale from 0 to 10 using [Memair emotions](https://memair.com). The nature of the pseduorandonly blocking leads to runs of blocked days followed by runs of unblocked days. In order to counter cross-over effect, the first two days after a state change (from blocked to unblocked or vice versa) will be ignored.

The experiment started on the 4th of May and will run for 60 days. The [results & calculations](https://github.com/memair/experiments/blob/master/2019-05-04%20Social%20media%20effect%20on%20self%20reported%20happiness.ipynb) will be published on GitHub.

I welcome any feedback, comments, or advice on experiment design. Make a prediction in the comments below!
