[Trampoline Day][1] is a self organised event and today was the first time the event had been held in Sydney. It is a two way dialogue where anyone who wishes gets an opportunity to run a talk. Mine was on Open Source and I'll upload the YouTube video shortly. Here are my notes from today.

Mornings talks

**Knowledge management** with Aprill @aprillarm  
50% of execs are at retirement age  
Knowledge management is a process  
Everyone can write, but don't use two words when one will do. Simple plan language.  
Don't need a fancy tool or template, it just needs to be organized.  
5 x W and a H.

**Peerfunding** with Tom from [StartSomeGood][3] @tomjd  
Tax benifits do not matter for crowd funding  
Emotional not tax benifits as reason for donations  
Crowd funding is peerfunding, a community not anonymous people  
Kick starter is not a crowd of people who like giving away money. Funds go to community products. Start with friends and your community.  
Know the names of your first 5 supporters  
You never see an empty tip jar  
Investment, have something you want, want to give, want you to succeed  
Kick starter is not a community, it is a tool.  
Ask for help.

**Community creativity and social change** with Michelle @mia_will  
Creating business that have a social environmental impact  
The way we interact with information is changing  
Social enterprise
