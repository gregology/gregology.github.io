It&#8217;s laura&#8217;s birthday today so we&#8217;re doing something tonight. I&#8217;m on the bus to work running a little late. George was sick this morning so Cathy couldn&#8217;t take me to work with her. The nerve of that two year old! My stop <img src="/wp-content/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> will finish later.
