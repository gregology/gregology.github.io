Here are my favourite female artists I've found on YouTube.  
The playlist:  
1. Sia - You've Changed - USA (This is an awesome film clip so a good starting point)  
2. Lisa Mitchell - Coin Laundry - Australia (I fell in love with Lisa after seeing this film clip, wow)  
3. Carla Bruni - Quelqu'un m'a dit - France (She has some amazing songs and some amazing film clips)  
4. Regina Spektor - On The Radio - USA (born in Russian SSR)  
5. Soko - Dandy Cowboys - France (Soko really sums up crazy chicks, I love her. I really like the YouTube film clip too)  
6. Alizée - J'en Ai Marre - France(wow, she's very sexy but I'm still cultured by watching her because she's French)  
7. Peter, Bjorn & John - Young Folks - Sweden (I am aware the there is a male singer here too :) )  
8. Camille - Ta Douleur - French (She mixes some really weird sounds)  
9. Ladyhawke - Paris Is Burning - New Zealand (Pretty cool song)  
10. Emilíana Torrini - Jungle Drum - Iceland (Good song, cool film clip)  
11. Lily Allen - LDN - England (I find her really sexy for some reason, which I don't understand because she's not that attractive, she doesn't hold her self well at all, and has an awful accent)  
12. Katie Melua - Shy Boy - England (Born in Georgian SSR)

These are not in order of preference, just an order that I think will make them most enjoyable. These song are not necessarily my favourite song by each artist, again the song was chosen to fit into a playlist. Also, I've kept a few artists out of this list such as MIA, Blondie, Shakira, Lady Gaga, and Katy Perry because I didn't want anyone knowing I was a fan :) If you know of any similar artists that I might like, please tell me in the comments.

Enjoy!
