I've got a niece and I can't wait to meet her. She was born this morning at about 1am. I had given out the duty sig phone number so I could get informed as soon as the little one came. I'm looking forward to my new toy and it's made me realise how much I miss Panda and Ollie. I heard Ollie is quite independent and Zander is getting around. It's sad missing out on this part of their life but it'll be nice having adventurous bed time stories to tell them.
