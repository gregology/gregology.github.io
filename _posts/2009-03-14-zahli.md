I&#8217;ve got a niece and I can&#8217;t wait to meet her. She was born this morning at about 1am. I had given out the duty sig phone number so I could get informed as soon as the little one came. I&#8217;m looking forward to my new toy and it&#8217;s made me realise how much I miss Panda and Ollie. I heard Ollie is quite independent and Zander is getting around. It&#8217;s sad missing out on this part of their life but it&#8217;ll be nice having adventurous bed time stories to tell them.
