we're in doolin at the moment about to head off to see some caves in the rain. We visited Trim, where my grandmother was born and found her mothers grave. I didn't know where the grave was and we played a morbid game of wheres wally. Chris won. I took some photos and the grave was well tended which was nice to know.

Saturday night was spent in Galway which is a party town but I wasn't feeling so good so I skived.
