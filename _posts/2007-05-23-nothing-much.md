I haven't blogged for a while because I haven't done a hell of a lot. Nathalie has been working and I've been a house husband :) We've got a residency at the hostel. It's really cool, we get our own room and they feed us breakfast every day and dinner every weekday, but best of all, our room has a bidet! Nathalie said I can't wizz in it :(  
We're off to Greece on the 12th for Nathalie's English teaching job. It's very exciting, i'll have to start again learning a whole new language. I've been in France for under 2 months and can get by on my own so I'm sure I'll be alright. The place we're going is on the water so I'm going to enjoy some much needed swimming, lots of cheese makes me happy but it's starting to show.
