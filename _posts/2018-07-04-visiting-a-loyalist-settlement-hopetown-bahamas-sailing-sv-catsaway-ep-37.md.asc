This week we explore Hopetown in the Abacos!

A loyalist settlement, Hopetown is a charming area, with colourful houses and winding pathways.  The most famous landmark in the area is the Elbow Reef Lighthouse.  The only remaining hand cranked kerosene lighthouse in the world, it's candy striped exterior only further enhances Hopetown's charm.  

A big industry in Hopetown was wrecking, which was the practice of salvaging shipwrecks on the barrier reef.  When the lighthouse was erected, the wrecking industry ceased to exist.

Joe from SV Barefoot Adventures came over to help us with our drive leg.  Unfortunately nothing could be done, but he confirmed our diagnosis that the seal and the bearings needed to be replaced.

We remembered Anzac Day with a dawn service at the cholera cemetery, and made some Anzac biscuits with our Sunflair Solar Oven.
