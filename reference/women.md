Women differ from normal people because they have long hair, boobies, and do not have a penis.

Their lack of penis restricts their ability to pee standing and because of this they have special toilets known as the ladies room which is denoted by this sign.

A women&#8217;s body is also the source of babies. When a man and a women cuddle in a certain way the women gets fat and after 9 months a baby comes out of the place that the penis is on normal people.
