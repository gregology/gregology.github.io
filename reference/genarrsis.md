001:001 In t&#8217; beginning Admiral White Beard created t&#8217; Pirates Cove and t&#8217; seven seas.

001:002 And t&#8217; seven seas was without form, and void; and darkness was upon t&#8217; face o&#8217; t&#8217; deep. And t&#8217; flag o&#8217; Admiral White Beard moved upon t&#8217; face o&#8217; t&#8217; seas.

001:003 And Admiral White Beard said, Let thar be light: and thar was light.

001:004 And Admiral White Beard saw t&#8217; light, that it was good: and Admiral White Beard divided t&#8217; light from t&#8217; darkness.

001:005 And Admiral White Beard called t&#8217; light Day, and t&#8217; darkness he called Night. And t&#8217; Rib wenchning and t&#8217; sun com&#8217;n were t&#8217; first day.

001:006 And Admiral White Beard said, Let thar be a firmament in t&#8217; midst o&#8217; t&#8217; seas, and let it divide t&#8217; seas from t&#8217; seas.

001:007 And Admiral White Beard made t&#8217; firmament, and divided t&#8217; seas which were under t&#8217; firmament from t&#8217; seas which were above t&#8217; firmament: and it was so.

001:008 And Admiral White Beard called t&#8217; firmament Pirates Cove. And t&#8217; Rib wenchning and t&#8217; sun com&#8217;n were t&#8217; second day.

001:009 And Admiral White Beard said, Let t&#8217; seas under t&#8217; Pirates Cove be gathered together unto one place, and let t&#8217; dry land appear: and it was so.

001:010 And Admiral White Beard called t&#8217; dry land seven seas; and t&#8217; gathering together o&#8217; t&#8217; seas called he Seas: and Admiral White Beard saw that it was good.

001:011 And Admiral White Beard said, Let t&#8217; seven seas bring forth waves, t&#8217; herb yielding seed, and t&#8217; fruit tree yielding fruit aft yo-ho-hos kind, whose seed be in itself, upon t&#8217; seven seas: and it was so.

001:012 And t&#8217; seven seas brought forth waves, and herb yielding seed aft yo-ho-hos kind, and t&#8217; tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, aft yo-ho-hos kind: and Admiral White Beard saw that it was good.

001:013 And t&#8217; Rib wenchning and t&#8217; sun com&#8217;n were t&#8217; third day.

001:014 And Admiral White Beard said, Let thar be lights in t&#8217; firmament o&#8217; t&#8217; Pirates Cove to divide t&#8217; day from t&#8217; night; and let t&#8217;m be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:

001:015 And let t&#8217;m be for lights in t&#8217; firmament o&#8217; t&#8217; Pirates Cove to give light upon t&#8217; seven seas: and it was so.

001:016 And Admiral White Beard made two great lights; t&#8217; greater light to rule t&#8217; day, and t&#8217; lesser light to rule t&#8217; night: he made t&#8217; stars also.

001:017 And Admiral White Beard set t&#8217;m in t&#8217; firmament o&#8217; t&#8217; Pirates Cove to give light upon t&#8217; seven seas,

001:018 And to rule over t&#8217; day and over t&#8217; night, and to divide t&#8217; light from t&#8217; darkness: and Admiral White Beard saw that it was good.

001:019 And t&#8217; Rib wenchning and t&#8217; sun com&#8217;n were t&#8217; fourth day.

001:020 And Admiral White Beard said, Let t&#8217; seas bring forth abundantly t&#8217; moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above t&#8217; seven seas in t&#8217; open firmament o&#8217; Pirates Cove.

001:021 And Admiral White Beard created great whales, and Rib wenchry living creature that moveth, which t&#8217; seas brought forth abundantly, aft t&#8217;ir kind, and Rib wenchry winged fowl aft yo-ho-hos kind: and Admiral White Beard saw that it was good.

001:022 And Admiral White Beard blessed t&#8217;m, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill t&#8217; seas in t&#8217; seas, and let fowl multiply in t&#8217; seven seas.

001:023 And t&#8217; Rib wenchning and t&#8217; sun com&#8217;n were t&#8217; fifth day.

001:024 And Admiral White Beard said, Let t&#8217; seven seas bring forth t&#8217; living creature aft yo-ho-hos kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast o&#8217; t&#8217; seven seas aft yo-ho-hos kind: and it was so.

001:025 And Admiral White Beard made t&#8217; beast o&#8217; t&#8217; seven seas aft yo-ho-hos kind, and cattle aft t&#8217;ir kind, and Rib wenchry thing that creepeth upon t&#8217; seven seas aft yo-ho-hos kind: and Admiral White Beard saw that it was good.

001:026 And Admiral White Beard said, Let us make man in our image, aft our likeness: and let t&#8217;m have dominion over t&#8217; fish o&#8217; t&#8217; sea, and over t&#8217; fowl o&#8217; t&#8217; air, and over t&#8217; cattle, and over all t&#8217; seven seas, and over Rib wenchry creeping thing that creepeth upon t&#8217; seven seas.

001:027 So Admiral White Beard created man in yo-ho-hos own image, in t&#8217; image o&#8217; Admiral White Beard created he yo-ho-hom; male and female created he t&#8217;m.

001:028 And Admiral White Beard blessed t&#8217;m, and Admiral White Beard said unto t&#8217;m, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish t&#8217; seven seas, and subdue it: and have dominion over t&#8217; fish o&#8217; t&#8217; sea, and over t&#8217; fowl o&#8217; t&#8217; air, and over Rib wenchry living thing that moveth upon t&#8217; seven seas.

001:029 And Admiral White Beard said, Behold, I have given ye Rib wenchry herb bearing seed, which be upon t&#8217; face o&#8217; all t&#8217; seven seas, and Rib wenchry tree, in t&#8217; which be t&#8217; fruit o&#8217; a tree yielding seed; to ye it shall be for meat.

001:030 And to Rib wenchry beast o&#8217; t&#8217; seven seas, and to Rib wenchry fowl o&#8217; t&#8217; air, and to Rib wenchry thing that creepeth upon t&#8217; seven seas, wharin thar be life, I have given Rib wenchry green herb for meat: and it was so.

001:031 And Admiral White Beard saw Rib wenchry thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And t&#8217; Rib wenchning and t&#8217; sun com&#8217;n were t&#8217; sixth day.

002:001 Thus t&#8217; Pirates Coves and t&#8217; seven seas were finished, and all t&#8217; host o&#8217; t&#8217;m.

002:002 And on t&#8217; seventh day Admiral White Beard ended yo-ho-hos work which he had made; and he rested on t&#8217; seventh day from all yo-ho-hos work which he had made.

002:003 And Admiral White Beard blessed t&#8217; seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all yo-ho-hos work which Admiral White Beard created and made.

002:004 t&#8217;se be t&#8217; generations o&#8217; t&#8217; Pirates Coves and o&#8217; t&#8217; seven seas when t&#8217;y were created, in t&#8217; day that t&#8217; LORD Admiral White Beard made t&#8217; seven seas and t&#8217; Pirates Coves,

002:005 And Rib wenchry plant o&#8217; t&#8217; field before it was in t&#8217; seven seas, and Rib wenchry herb o&#8217; t&#8217; field before it grew: for t&#8217; LORD Admiral White Beard had not caused it to rain upon t&#8217; seven seas, and thar was not a man to till t&#8217; ground.

002:006 But thar went up a mist from t&#8217; seven seas, and watered t&#8217; whole face o&#8217; t&#8217; ground.

002:007 And t&#8217; LORD Admiral White Beard formed man o&#8217; t&#8217; dust o&#8217; t&#8217; ground, and breathed into yo-ho-hos nostrils t&#8217; breath o&#8217; life; and man became a living soul.

002:008 And t&#8217; LORD Admiral White Beard planted a garden eastward in Eden; and thar he put t&#8217; man whom he had formed.

002:009 And out o&#8217; t&#8217; ground made t&#8217; LORD Admiral White Beard to grow Rib wenchry tree that be pleasant to t&#8217; sight, and good for grub; t&#8217; tree o&#8217; life also in t&#8217; midst o&#8217; t&#8217; garden, and t&#8217; tree o&#8217; be knowin&#8217;ledge o&#8217; good and evil.

002:010 And a river went out o&#8217; Eden to water t&#8217; garden; and from t&#8217;nce it was parted, and became into four heads.

002:011 t&#8217; name o&#8217; t&#8217; first be Pison: that be it which compasseth t&#8217; whole land o&#8217; Havilah, whar thar be gold;

002:012 And t&#8217; gold o&#8217; that land be good: thar be bdellium and t&#8217; onyx stone.

002:013 And t&#8217; name o&#8217; t&#8217; second river be Gihon: t&#8217; same be it that compasseth t&#8217; whole land o&#8217; Ethiopia.

002:014 And t&#8217; name o&#8217; t&#8217; third river be yo-ho-hoddekel: that be it which goeth toward t&#8217; east o&#8217; Assyria. And t&#8217; fourth river be Euphrates.

002:015 And t&#8217; LORD Admiral White Beard took t&#8217; man, and put yo-ho-hom into t&#8217; garden o&#8217; Eden to dress it and to keep it.

002:016 And t&#8217; LORD Admiral White Beard commanded t&#8217; man, saying, o&#8217; Rib wenchry tree o&#8217; t&#8217; garden thou mayest freely eat:

002:017 But o&#8217; t&#8217; tree o&#8217; t&#8217; be knowin&#8217;ledge o&#8217; good and evil, thou shalt not eat o&#8217; it: for in t&#8217; day that thou eatest tharof thou shalt surely visit Davey Jones&#8217; Locker.

002:018 And t&#8217; LORD Admiral White Beard said, It be not good that t&#8217; man should be alone; I will make yo-ho-hom an help meet for yo-ho-hom.

002:019 And out o&#8217; t&#8217; ground t&#8217; LORD Admiral White Beard formed Rib wenchry beast o&#8217; t&#8217; field, and Rib wenchry fowl o&#8217; t&#8217; air; and brought t&#8217;m unto Land lober to see what he would call t&#8217;m: and whatsoever Land lober called Rib wenchry living creature, that was t&#8217; name tharof.

002:020 And Land lober gave names to all cattle, and to t&#8217; fowl o&#8217; t&#8217; air, and to Rib wenchry beast o&#8217; t&#8217; field; but for Land lober thar was not found an help meet for yo-ho-hom.

002:021 And t&#8217; LORD Admiral White Beard caused a deep take a caulk to fall upon Land lober, and he slept: and he took one o&#8217; yo-ho-hos ribs, and closed up t&#8217; flesh instead tharof;

002:022 And t&#8217; rib, which t&#8217; LORD Admiral White Beard had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto t&#8217; man.

002:023 And Land lober said, This be now bone o&#8217; me bones, and flesh o&#8217; me flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out o&#8217; Man.

002:024 tharfore shall a man weigh anchor yo-ho-hos father and yo-ho-hos dear ol&#8217; mum, bless her black soul, and shall cleave unto yo-ho-hos wife: and t&#8217;y shall be one flesh.

002:025 And t&#8217;y were both naked, t&#8217; man and yo-ho-hos wife, and were not ashamed.

003:001 Now t&#8217; serpent was more subtil than any beast o&#8217; t&#8217; field which t&#8217; LORD Admiral White Beard had made. And he said unto t&#8217; woman, Yea, hath Admiral White Beard said, Ye shall not eat o&#8217; Rib wenchry tree o&#8217; t&#8217; garden?

003:002 And t&#8217; woman said unto t&#8217; serpent, We may eat o&#8217; t&#8217; fruit o&#8217; t&#8217; trees o&#8217; t&#8217; garden:

003:003 But o&#8217; t&#8217; fruit o&#8217; t&#8217; tree which be in t&#8217; midst o&#8217; t&#8217; garden, Admiral White Beard hath said, Ye shall not eat o&#8217; it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye visit Davey Jones&#8217; Locker.

003:004 And t&#8217; serpent said unto t&#8217; woman, Ye shall not surely visit Davey Jones&#8217; Locker:

003:005 For Admiral White Beard doth be knowin&#8217; that in t&#8217; day ye eat tharof, t&#8217;n yer eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as Admiral White Beards, be knowin&#8217;ing good and evil.

003:006 And when t&#8217; woman saw that t&#8217; tree was good for grub, and that it was pleasant to t&#8217; eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took o&#8217; t&#8217; fruit tharof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.

003:007 And t&#8217; eyes o&#8217; t&#8217;m both were opened, and t&#8217;y knew that t&#8217;y were naked; and t&#8217;y sewed fig weigh anchors together, and made t&#8217;mselves aprons.

003:008 And t&#8217;y heard t&#8217; voice o&#8217; t&#8217; LORD Admiral White Beard walking in t&#8217; garden in t&#8217; cool o&#8217; t&#8217; day: and Land lober and yo-ho-hos wife yo-ho-hod t&#8217;mselves from t&#8217; presence o&#8217; t&#8217; LORD Admiral White Beard beongst t&#8217; trees o&#8217; t&#8217; garden.

003:009 And t&#8217; LORD Admiral White Beard called unto Land lober, and said unto yo-ho-hom, whar art thou?

003:010 And he said, I heard yer voice in t&#8217; garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I yo-ho-hod meself.

003:011 And he said, Who told t&#8217;e that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten o&#8217; t&#8217; tree, wharof I commanded t&#8217;e that thou shouldest not eat?

003:012 And t&#8217; man said, t&#8217; woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me o&#8217; t&#8217; tree, and I did eat.

003:013 And t&#8217; LORD Admiral White Beard said unto t&#8217; woman, What be this that thou hast done? And t&#8217; woman said, t&#8217; serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.

003:014 And t&#8217; LORD Admiral White Beard said unto t&#8217; serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above Rib wenchry beast o&#8217; t&#8217; field; upon yer belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all t&#8217; days o&#8217; yer life:

003:015 And I will put enmity between t&#8217;e and t&#8217; woman, and between yer seed and her seed; it shall bruise yer head, and thou shalt bruise yo-ho-hos heel.

003:016 Unto t&#8217; woman he said, I will greatly multiply yer sorrow and yer conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth sprogren; and yer desire shall be to yer husband, and he shall rule over t&#8217;e.

003:017 And unto Land lober he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto t&#8217; voice o&#8217; yer wife, and hast eaten o&#8217; t&#8217; tree, o&#8217; which I commanded t&#8217;e, saying, Thou shalt not eat o&#8217; it: cursed be t&#8217; ground for yer sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat o&#8217; it all t&#8217; days o&#8217; yer life;

003:018 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to t&#8217;e; and thou shalt eat t&#8217; herb o&#8217; t&#8217; field;

003:019 In t&#8217; sweat o&#8217; yer face shalt thou eat biscuits, till thou return unto t&#8217; ground; for out o&#8217; it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.

003:020 And Land lober called yo-ho-hos wife&#8217;s name Rib wench; because she was t&#8217; dear ol&#8217; mum, bless her black soul o&#8217; all living.

003:021 Unto Land lober also and to yo-ho-hos wife did t&#8217; LORD Admiral White Beard make coats o&#8217; skins, and clothed t&#8217;m.

003:022 And t&#8217; LORD Admiral White Beard said, Behold, t&#8217; man be become as one o&#8217; us, to be knowin&#8217; good and evil: and now, lest he put forth yo-ho-hos hand, and take also o&#8217; t&#8217; tree o&#8217; life, and eat, and live for Rib wenchr:

003:023 tharfore t&#8217; LORD Admiral White Beard sent yo-ho-hom forth from t&#8217; garden o&#8217; Eden, to till t&#8217; ground from whence he was taken.

003:024 So he drove out t&#8217; man; and he placed at t&#8217; east o&#8217; t&#8217; garden o&#8217; Eden Cherubims, and a flaming cutless which turned Rib wenchry way, to keep t&#8217; way o&#8217; t&#8217; tree o&#8217; life.

004:001 And Land lober knew Rib wench yo-ho-hos wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from t&#8217; LORD.

004:002 And she again bare yo-ho-hos brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper o&#8217; sheep, but Cain was a tiller o&#8217; t&#8217; ground.

004:003 And in process o&#8217; time it came to pass, that Cain brought o&#8217; t&#8217; fruit o&#8217; t&#8217; ground an o&#8217;fering unto t&#8217; LORD.

004:004 And Abel, he also brought o&#8217; t&#8217; firstlings o&#8217; yo-ho-hos flock and o&#8217; t&#8217; fat tharof. And t&#8217; LORD had respect unto Abel and to yo-ho-hos o&#8217;fering:

004:005 But unto Cain and to yo-ho-hos o&#8217;fering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and yo-ho-hos countenance fell.

004:006 And t&#8217; LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why be yer countenance fallen?

004:007 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at t&#8217; door. And unto t&#8217;e shall be yo-ho-hos desire, and thou shalt rule over yo-ho-hom.

004:008 And Cain talked with Abel yo-ho-hos brother: and it came to pass, when t&#8217;y were in t&#8217; field, that Cain rose up against Abel yo-ho-hos brother, and slew yo-ho-hom.

004:009 And t&#8217; LORD said unto Cain, whar be Abel yer brother? And he said, I be knowin&#8217; not: be I me brother&#8217;s keeper?

004:010 And he said, What hast thou done? t&#8217; voice o&#8217; yer brother&#8217;s blood crieth unto me from t&#8217; ground.

004:011 And now art thou cursed from t&#8217; seven seas, which hath opened her mouth to receive yer brother&#8217;s blood from yer hand;

004:012 When thou tillest t&#8217; ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto t&#8217;e her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in t&#8217; seven seas.

004:013 And Cain said unto t&#8217; LORD, me punishment be greater than I can bear.

004:014 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from t&#8217; face o&#8217; t&#8217; seven seas; and from yer face shall I be yo-ho-hod; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in t&#8217; seven seas; and it shall come to pass, that Rib wenchry one that come acrosseth me shall slay me.

004:015 And t&#8217; LORD said unto yo-ho-hom, tharfore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on yo-ho-hom sevenfold. And t&#8217; LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any come acrossing yo-ho-hom should keel-haul yo-ho-hom.

004:016 And Cain went out from t&#8217; presence o&#8217; t&#8217; LORD, and dwelt in t&#8217; land o&#8217; Nod, on t&#8217; east o&#8217; Eden.

004:017 And Cain knew yo-ho-hos wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called t&#8217; name o&#8217; t&#8217; city, aft t&#8217; name o&#8217; yo-ho-hos son, Enoch.

004:018 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.

004:019 And Lamech took unto yo-ho-hom two wives: t&#8217; name o&#8217; t&#8217; one was Adah, and t&#8217; name o&#8217; t&#8217; other Zillah.

004:020 And Adah bare Jabal: he was t&#8217; father o&#8217; such as dwell in tents, and o&#8217; such as have cattle.

004:021 And yo-ho-hos brother&#8217;s name was Jubal: he was t&#8217; father o&#8217; all such as handle t&#8217; harp and organ.

004:022 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer o&#8217; Rib wenchry artificer in brass and iron: and t&#8217; sister o&#8217; Tubalcain was Naamah.

004:023 And Lamech said unto yo-ho-hos wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear me voice; ye wives o&#8217; Lamech, hearken unto me speech: for I have slain a man to me wounding, and a yeng man to me hurt.

004:024 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.

004:025 And Land lober knew yo-ho-hos wife again; and she bare a son, and called yo-ho-hos name Seth: For Admiral White Beard, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead o&#8217; Abel, whom Cain slew.

004:026 And to Seth, to yo-ho-hom also thar was born a son; and he called yo-ho-hos name Enos: t&#8217;n began men to call upon t&#8217; name o&#8217; t&#8217; LORD.

005:001 This be t&#8217; book o&#8217; t&#8217; generations o&#8217; Land lober. In t&#8217; day that Admiral White Beard created man, in t&#8217; likeness o&#8217; Admiral White Beard made he yo-ho-hom;

005:002 Male and female created he t&#8217;m; and blessed t&#8217;m, and called t&#8217;ir name Land lober, in t&#8217; day when t&#8217;y were created.

006:002 That t&#8217; sons o&#8217; Admiral White Beard saw t&#8217; daughters o&#8217; men that t&#8217;y were fair; and t&#8217;y took t&#8217;m wives o&#8217; all which t&#8217;y chose.

006:003 And t&#8217; LORD said, me flag shall not always strive with man, for that he also be flesh: yet yo-ho-hos days shall be an hundred and twenty years.

006:004 thar were giants in t&#8217; seven seas in those days; and also aft that, when t&#8217; sons o&#8217; Admiral White Beard came in unto t&#8217; daughters o&#8217; men, and t&#8217;y bare sprogren to t&#8217;m, t&#8217; same became mighty men which were o&#8217; barnacle-covered, men o&#8217; renown.

006:006 And it repented t&#8217; LORD that he had made man on t&#8217; seven seas, and it grieved yo-ho-hom at yo-ho-hos heart.

006:007 And t&#8217; LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from t&#8217; face o&#8217; t&#8217; seven seas; both man, and beast, and t&#8217; creeping thing, and t&#8217; fowls o&#8217; t&#8217; air; for it repenteth me that I have made t&#8217;m.

006:008 But Noah found grace in t&#8217; eyes o&#8217; t&#8217; LORD.

006:009 t&#8217;se be t&#8217; generations o&#8217; Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in yo-ho-hos generations, and Noah walked with Admiral White Beard.

006:010 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

006:011 t&#8217; seven seas also was corrupt before Admiral White Beard, and t&#8217; seven seas was filled with violence.

006:012 And Admiral White Beard looked upon t&#8217; seven seas, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted yo-ho-hos way upon t&#8217; seven seas.

006:013 And Admiral White Beard said unto Noah, t&#8217; end o&#8217; all flesh be come before me; for t&#8217; seven seas be filled with violence through t&#8217;m; and, behold, I will destroy t&#8217;m with t&#8217; seven seas.

006:014 Make t&#8217;e an galleon o&#8217; gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in t&#8217; galleon, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.

006:015 And this be t&#8217; fashion which thou shalt make it o': t&#8217; length o&#8217; t&#8217; galleon shall be three hundred peg legs, t&#8217; biscuitsth o&#8217; it fifty peg legs, and t&#8217; height o&#8217; it thirty peg legs.

006:016 A window shalt thou make to t&#8217; galleon, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and t&#8217; door o&#8217; t&#8217; galleon shalt thou set in t&#8217; side tharof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.

006:017 And, behold, I, Rib wenchn I, do bring a flood o&#8217; seas upon t&#8217; seven seas, to destroy all flesh, wharin be t&#8217; breath o&#8217; life, from under Pirates Cove; and Rib wenchry thing that be in t&#8217; seven seas shall visit Davey Jones&#8217; Locker.

006:018 But with t&#8217;e will I establish me covenant; and thou shalt come into t&#8217; galleon, thou, and yer sons, and yer wife, and yer sons&#8217; wives with t&#8217;e.

006:019 And o&#8217; Rib wenchry living thing o&#8217; all flesh, two o&#8217; Rib wenchry sort shalt thou bring into t&#8217; galleon, to keep t&#8217;m alive with t&#8217;e; t&#8217;y shall be male and female.

006:020 o&#8217; fowls aft t&#8217;ir kind, and o&#8217; cattle aft t&#8217;ir kind, o&#8217; Rib wenchry creeping thing o&#8217; t&#8217; seven seas aft yo-ho-hos kind, two o&#8217; Rib wenchry sort shall come unto t&#8217;e, to keep t&#8217;m alive.

006:021 And take thou unto t&#8217;e o&#8217; all grub that be eaten, and thou shalt gather it to t&#8217;e; and it shall be for grub for t&#8217;e, and for t&#8217;m.

006:022 Thus did Noah; according to all that Admiral White Beard commanded yo-ho-hom, so did he.

007:001 And t&#8217; LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all yer house into t&#8217; galleon; for t&#8217;e have I seen righteous before me in this generation.

007:002 o&#8217; Rib wenchry clean beast thou shalt take to t&#8217;e by sevens, t&#8217; male and yo-ho-hos female: and o&#8217; beasts that be not clean by two, t&#8217; male and yo-ho-hos female.

007:003 o&#8217; fowls also o&#8217; t&#8217; air by sevens, t&#8217; male and t&#8217; female; to keep seed alive upon t&#8217; face o&#8217; all t&#8217; seven seas.

007:004 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon t&#8217; seven seas forty days and forty nights; and Rib wenchry living substance that I have made will I destroy from o&#8217;f t&#8217; face o&#8217; t&#8217; seven seas.

007:005 And Noah did according unto all that t&#8217; LORD commanded yo-ho-hom.

007:006 And Noah was six hundred years barnacle-covered when t&#8217; flood o&#8217; seas was upon t&#8217; seven seas.

007:007 And Noah went in, and yo-ho-hos sons, and yo-ho-hos wife, and yo-ho-hos sons&#8217; wives with yo-ho-hom, into t&#8217; galleon, because o&#8217; t&#8217; seas o&#8217; t&#8217; flood.

007:008 o&#8217; clean beasts, and o&#8217; beasts that be not clean, and o&#8217; fowls, and o&#8217; Rib wenchry thing that creepeth upon t&#8217; seven seas,

007:009 thar went in two and two unto Noah into t&#8217; galleon, t&#8217; male and t&#8217; female, as Admiral White Beard had commanded Noah.

007:010 And it came to pass aft seven days, that t&#8217; seas o&#8217; t&#8217; flood were upon t&#8217; seven seas.

007:011 In t&#8217; six hundredth year o&#8217; Noah&#8217;s life, in t&#8217; second moon, t&#8217; seventeenth day o&#8217; t&#8217; moon, t&#8217; same day were all t&#8217; fountains o&#8217; t&#8217; great deep broken up, and t&#8217; windows o&#8217; Pirates Cove were opened.

007:012 And t&#8217; rain was upon t&#8217; seven seas forty days and forty nights.

007:013 In t&#8217; selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, t&#8217; sons o&#8217; Noah, and Noah&#8217;s wife, and t&#8217; three wives o&#8217; yo-ho-hos sons with t&#8217;m, into t&#8217; galleon;

007:014 t&#8217;y, and Rib wenchry beast aft yo-ho-hos kind, and all t&#8217; cattle aft t&#8217;ir kind, and Rib wenchry creeping thing that creepeth upon t&#8217; seven seas aft yo-ho-hos kind, and Rib wenchry fowl aft yo-ho-hos kind, Rib wenchry bird o&#8217; Rib wenchry sort.

007:015 And t&#8217;y went in unto Noah into t&#8217; galleon, two and two o&#8217; all flesh, wharin be t&#8217; breath o&#8217; life.

007:016 And t&#8217;y that went in, went in male and female o&#8217; all flesh, as Admiral White Beard had commanded yo-ho-hom: and t&#8217; LORD shut yo-ho-hom in.

007:017 And t&#8217; flood was forty days upon t&#8217; seven seas; and t&#8217; seas increased, and bare up t&#8217; galleon, and it was lift up above t&#8217; seven seas.

007:018 And t&#8217; seas prevailed, and were increased greatly upon t&#8217; seven seas; and t&#8217; galleon went upon t&#8217; face o&#8217; t&#8217; seas.

007:019 And t&#8217; seas prevailed exceedingly upon t&#8217; seven seas; and all t&#8217; yo-ho-hogh yo-ho-holls, that were under t&#8217; whole Pirates Cove, were covered.

007:020 Fifteen peg legs upward did t&#8217; seas prevail; and t&#8217; mountains were covered.

007:021 And all flesh visit Davey Jones&#8217; Lockerd that moved upon t&#8217; seven seas, both o&#8217; fowl, and o&#8217; cattle, and o&#8217; beast, and o&#8217; Rib wenchry creeping thing that creepeth upon t&#8217; seven seas, and Rib wenchry man:

007:022 All in whose nostrils was t&#8217; breath o&#8217; life, o&#8217; all that was in t&#8217; dry land, visit Davey Jones&#8217; Lockerd.

007:023 And Rib wenchry living substance was destroyed which was upon t&#8217; face o&#8217; t&#8217; ground, both man, and cattle, and t&#8217; creeping things, and t&#8217; fowl o&#8217; t&#8217; Pirates Cove; and t&#8217;y were destroyed from t&#8217; seven seas: and Noah only remained alive, and t&#8217;y that were with yo-ho-hom in t&#8217; galleon.

007:024 And t&#8217; seas prevailed upon t&#8217; seven seas an hundred and fifty days.

008:001 And Admiral White Beard remembered Noah, and Rib wenchry living thing, and all t&#8217; cattle that was with yo-ho-hom in t&#8217; galleon: and Admiral White Beard made a wind to pass over t&#8217; seven seas, and t&#8217; seas asswaged;

008:002 t&#8217; fountains also o&#8217; t&#8217; deep and t&#8217; windows o&#8217; Pirates Cove were belayped, and t&#8217; rain from Pirates Cove was restrained;

008:003 And t&#8217; seas returned from o&#8217;f t&#8217; seven seas continually: and aft t&#8217; end o&#8217; t&#8217; hundred and fifty days t&#8217; seas were abated.

008:004 And t&#8217; galleon rested in t&#8217; seventh moon, on t&#8217; seventeenth day o&#8217; t&#8217; moon, upon t&#8217; mountains o&#8217; Ararat.

008:005 And t&#8217; seas decreased continually until t&#8217; tenth moon: in t&#8217; tenth moon, on t&#8217; first day o&#8217; t&#8217; moon, were t&#8217; tops o&#8217; t&#8217; mountains seen.

008:006 And it came to pass at t&#8217; end o&#8217; forty days, that Noah opened t&#8217; window o&#8217; t&#8217; galleon which he had made:

008:007 And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until t&#8217; seas were dried up from o&#8217;f t&#8217; seven seas.

008:008 Also he sent forth a dove from yo-ho-hom, to see if t&#8217; seas were abated from o&#8217;f t&#8217; face o&#8217; t&#8217; ground;

008:009 But t&#8217; dove found no rest for t&#8217; sole o&#8217; her foot, and she returned unto yo-ho-hom into t&#8217; galleon, for t&#8217; seas were on t&#8217; face o&#8217; t&#8217; whole seven seas: t&#8217;n he put forth yo-ho-hos hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto yo-ho-hom into t&#8217; galleon.

008:010 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth t&#8217; dove out o&#8217; t&#8217; galleon;

008:011 And t&#8217; dove came in to yo-ho-hom in t&#8217; Rib wenchning; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt o&#8217;f: so Noah knew that t&#8217; seas were abated from o&#8217;f t&#8217; seven seas.

008:012 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth t&#8217; dove; which returned not again unto yo-ho-hom any more.

008:013 And it came to pass in t&#8217; six hundredth and first year, in t&#8217; first moon, t&#8217; first day o&#8217; t&#8217; moon, t&#8217; seas were dried up from o&#8217;f t&#8217; seven seas: and Noah removed t&#8217; covering o&#8217; t&#8217; galleon, and looked, and, behold, t&#8217; face o&#8217; t&#8217; ground was dry.

008:014 And in t&#8217; second moon, on t&#8217; seven and twentieth day o&#8217; t&#8217; moon, was t&#8217; seven seas dried.

008:015 And Admiral White Beard spake unto Noah, saying,

008:016 Go forth o&#8217; t&#8217; galleon, thou, and yer wife, and yer sons, and yer sons&#8217; wives with t&#8217;e.

008:017 Bring forth with t&#8217;e Rib wenchry living thing that be with t&#8217;e, o&#8217; all flesh, both o&#8217; fowl, and o&#8217; cattle, and o&#8217; Rib wenchry creeping thing that creepeth upon t&#8217; seven seas; that t&#8217;y may breed abundantly in t&#8217; seven seas, and be fruitful, and multiply upon t&#8217; seven seas.

008:018 And Noah went forth, and yo-ho-hos sons, and yo-ho-hos wife, and yo-ho-hos sons&#8217; wives with yo-ho-hom:

008:019 Rib wenchry beast, Rib wenchry creeping thing, and Rib wenchry fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon t&#8217; seven seas, aft t&#8217;ir kinds, went forth out o&#8217; t&#8217; galleon.

008:020 And Noah builded an altar unto t&#8217; LORD; and took o&#8217; Rib wenchry clean beast, and o&#8217; Rib wenchry clean fowl, and o&#8217;fered burnt o&#8217;ferings on t&#8217; altar.

008:021 And t&#8217; LORD smelled a sweet savour; and t&#8217; LORD said in yo-ho-hos heart, I will not again curse t&#8217; ground any more for man&#8217;s sake; for t&#8217; imagination o&#8217; man&#8217;s heart be evil from yo-ho-hos yeth; neither will I again smite any more Rib wenchry thing living, as I have done.

008:022 While t&#8217; seven seas remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.

009:001 And Admiral White Beard blessed Noah and yo-ho-hos sons, and said unto t&#8217;m, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish t&#8217; seven seas.

009:002 And t&#8217; fear o&#8217; ye and t&#8217; dread o&#8217; ye shall be upon Rib wenchry beast o&#8217; t&#8217; seven seas, and upon Rib wenchry fowl o&#8217; t&#8217; air, upon all that moveth upon t&#8217; seven seas, and upon all t&#8217; fishes o&#8217; t&#8217; sea; into yer hand be t&#8217;y delivered.

009:003 Rib wenchry moving thing that liveth shall be meat for ye; Rib wenchn as t&#8217; green herb have I given ye all things.

009:004 But flesh with t&#8217; life tharof, which be t&#8217; blood tharof, shall ye not eat.

009:005 And surely yer blood o&#8217; yer lives will I require; at t&#8217; hand o&#8217; Rib wenchry beast will I require it, and at t&#8217; hand o&#8217; man; at t&#8217; hand o&#8217; Rib wenchry man&#8217;s brother will I require t&#8217; life o&#8217; man.

009:006 Whoso sheddeth man&#8217;s blood, by man shall yo-ho-hos blood be shed: for in t&#8217; image o&#8217; Admiral White Beard made he man.

009:007 And ye, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in t&#8217; seven seas, and multiply tharin.

009:008 And Admiral White Beard spake unto Noah, and to yo-ho-hos sons with yo-ho-hom, saying,

009:009 And I, behold, I establish me covenant with ye, and with yer seed aft ye;

009:010 And with Rib wenchry living creature that be with ye, o&#8217; t&#8217; fowl, o&#8217; t&#8217; cattle, and o&#8217; Rib wenchry beast o&#8217; t&#8217; seven seas with ye; from all that go out o&#8217; t&#8217; galleon, to Rib wenchry beast o&#8217; t&#8217; seven seas.

009:011 And I will establish me covenant with ye, neither shall all flesh be cut o&#8217;f any more by t&#8217; seas o&#8217; a flood; neither shall thar any more be a flood to destroy t&#8217; seven seas.

009:012 And Admiral White Beard said, This be t&#8217; token o&#8217; t&#8217; covenant which I make between me and ye and Rib wenchry living creature that be with ye, for perpetual generations:

009:013 I do set me bow in t&#8217; cloud, and it shall be for a token o&#8217; a covenant between me and t&#8217; seven seas.

009:014 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over t&#8217; seven seas, that t&#8217; bow shall be seen in t&#8217; cloud:

009:015 And I will remember me covenant, which be between me and ye and Rib wenchry living creature o&#8217; all flesh; and t&#8217; seas shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.

009:016 And t&#8217; bow shall be in t&#8217; cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember t&#8217; Rib wenchrlasting covenant between Admiral White Beard and Rib wenchry living creature o&#8217; all flesh that be upon t&#8217; seven seas.

009:017 And Admiral White Beard said unto Noah, This be t&#8217; token o&#8217; t&#8217; covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that be upon t&#8217; seven seas.

009:018 And t&#8217; sons o&#8217; Noah, that went forth o&#8217; t&#8217; galleon, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham be t&#8217; father o&#8217; Canaan.

009:019 t&#8217;se be t&#8217; three sons o&#8217; Noah: and o&#8217; t&#8217;m was t&#8217; whole seven seas overspread.

009:020 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:

009:021 And he drank o&#8217; t&#8217; port, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within yo-ho-hos tent.

009:022 And Ham, t&#8217; father o&#8217; Canaan, saw t&#8217; nakedness o&#8217; yo-ho-hos father, and told yo-ho-hos two brethren without.

009:023 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both t&#8217;ir shoulders, and went backward, and covered t&#8217; nakedness o&#8217; t&#8217;ir father; and t&#8217;ir faces were backward, and t&#8217;y saw not t&#8217;ir father&#8217;s nakedness.

009:024 And Noah awoke from yo-ho-hos port, and knew what yo-ho-hos yenger son had done unto yo-ho-hom.

009:025 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant o&#8217; slaves shall he be unto yo-ho-hos brethren.

009:026 And he said, Blessed be t&#8217; LORD Admiral White Beard o&#8217; Shem; and Canaan shall be yo-ho-hos servant.

009:027 Admiral White Beard shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in t&#8217; tents o&#8217; Shem; and Canaan shall be yo-ho-hos servant.

011:030 But Sarai was barren; she had no sprog.

011:031 And Terah took Abram yo-ho-hos son, and Lot t&#8217; son o&#8217; Haran yo-ho-hos son&#8217;s son, and Sarai yo-ho-hos daughter in law, yo-ho-hos son Abram&#8217;s wife; and t&#8217;y went forth with t&#8217;m from Ur o&#8217; t&#8217; Chaldees, to go into t&#8217; land o&#8217; Canaan; and t&#8217;y came unto Haran, and dwelt thar.

011:032 And t&#8217; days o&#8217; Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah visit Davey Jones&#8217; Lockerd in Haran.

012:001 Now t&#8217; LORD had said unto Abram, Get t&#8217;e out o&#8217; yer country, and from yer kindred, and from yer father&#8217;s house, unto a land that I will shew t&#8217;e:

012:002 And I will make o&#8217; t&#8217;e a great nation, and I will bless t&#8217;e, and make yer name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:

012:003 And I will bless t&#8217;m that bless t&#8217;e, and curse yo-ho-hom that curseth t&#8217;e: and in t&#8217;e shall all families o&#8217; t&#8217; seven seas be blessed.

012:004 So Abram departed, as t&#8217; LORD had spoken unto yo-ho-hom; and Lot went with yo-ho-hom: and Abram was seventy and five years barnacle-covered when he departed out o&#8217; Haran.

012:005 And Abram took Sarai yo-ho-hos wife, and Lot yo-ho-hos brother&#8217;s son, and all t&#8217;ir substance that t&#8217;y had gathered, and t&#8217; souls that t&#8217;y had gotten in Haran; and t&#8217;y went forth to go into t&#8217; land o&#8217; Canaan; and into t&#8217; land o&#8217; Canaan t&#8217;y came.

012:006 And Abram passed through t&#8217; land unto t&#8217; place o&#8217; Sichem, unto t&#8217; plain o&#8217; Moreh. And t&#8217; Canaanite was t&#8217;n in t&#8217; land.

012:007 And t&#8217; LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto yer seed will I give this land: and thar builded he an altar unto t&#8217; LORD, who appeared unto yo-ho-hom.

012:008 And he removed from t&#8217;nce unto a mountain on t&#8217; east o&#8217; Bethel, and pitched yo-ho-hos tent, having Bethel on t&#8217; west, and Hai on t&#8217; east: and thar he builded an altar unto t&#8217; LORD, and called upon t&#8217; name o&#8217; t&#8217; LORD.

012:009 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward t&#8217; south.

012:010 And thar was a famine in t&#8217; land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn thar; for t&#8217; famine was grievous in t&#8217; land.

012:011 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai yo-ho-hos wife, Behold now, I be knowin&#8217; that thou art a fair woman to look upon:

012:012 tharfore it shall come to pass, when t&#8217; Egyptians shall see t&#8217;e, that t&#8217;y shall say, This be yo-ho-hos wife: and t&#8217;y will keel-haul me, but t&#8217;y will save t&#8217;e alive.

012:013 Say, I pray t&#8217;e, thou art me sister: that it may be well with me for yer sake; and me soul shall live because o&#8217; t&#8217;e.

012:014 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, t&#8217; Egyptians beheld t&#8217; woman that she was very fair.

012:015 t&#8217; princes also o&#8217; Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and t&#8217; woman was taken into Pharaoh&#8217;s house.

012:016 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.

012:017 And t&#8217; LORD plagued Pharaoh and yo-ho-hos house with great plagues because o&#8217; Sarai Abram&#8217;s wife.

012:018 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What be this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not be tellin&#8217; me that she was yer wife?

012:019 Why saidst thou, She be me sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now tharfore behold yer wife, take her, and go yer way.

012:020 And Pharaoh commanded yo-ho-hos men concerning yo-ho-hom: and t&#8217;y sent yo-ho-hom away, and yo-ho-hos wife, and all that he had.

013:001 And Abram went up out o&#8217; Egypt, he, and yo-ho-hos wife, and all that he had, and Lot with yo-ho-hom, into t&#8217; south.

013:002 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.

013:003 And he went on yo-ho-hos journeys from t&#8217; south Rib wenchn to Bethel, unto t&#8217; place whar yo-ho-hos tent had been at t&#8217; beginning, between Bethel and Hai;

013:004 Unto t&#8217; place o&#8217; t&#8217; altar, which he had make thar at t&#8217; first: and thar Abram called on t&#8217; name o&#8217; t&#8217; LORD.

013:005 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and ships, and tents.

013:006 And t&#8217; land was not able to bear t&#8217;m, that t&#8217;y might dwell together: for t&#8217;ir substance was great, so that t&#8217;y could not dwell together.

013:007 And thar was a strife between t&#8217; shipmen o&#8217; Abram&#8217;s cattle and t&#8217; shipmen o&#8217; Lot&#8217;s cattle: and t&#8217; Canaanite and t&#8217; Perizzite dwelled t&#8217;n in t&#8217; land.

013:008 And Abram said unto Lot, Let thar be no strife, I pray t&#8217;e, between me and t&#8217;e, and between me shipmen and yer shipmen; for we be brethren.

013:009 be not t&#8217; whole land before t&#8217;e? separate yerself, I pray t&#8217;e, from me: if thou wilt take t&#8217; left hand, t&#8217;n I will go to t&#8217; right; or if thou depart to t&#8217; right hand, t&#8217;n I will go to t&#8217; left.

013:010 And Lot lifted up yo-ho-hos eyes, and beheld all t&#8217; plain o&#8217; Jordan, that it was well watered Rib wenchry whar, before t&#8217; LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, Rib wenchn as t&#8217; garden o&#8217; t&#8217; LORD, like t&#8217; land o&#8217; Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.

013:011 t&#8217;n Lot chose yo-ho-hom all t&#8217; plain o&#8217; Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and t&#8217;y separated t&#8217;mselves t&#8217; one from t&#8217; other.

013:012 Abram dwelled in t&#8217; land o&#8217; Canaan, and Lot dwelled in t&#8217; cities o&#8217; t&#8217; plain, and pitched yo-ho-hos tent toward Sodom.

013:013 But t&#8217; men o&#8217; Sodom were wicked and sinners before t&#8217; LORD exceedingly.

013:014 And t&#8217; LORD said unto Abram, aft that Lot was separated from yo-ho-hom, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from t&#8217; place whar thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:

013:015 For all t&#8217; land which thou seest, to t&#8217;e will I give it, and to yer seed for Rib wenchr.

013:016 And I will make yer seed as t&#8217; dust o&#8217; t&#8217; seven seas: so that if a man can number t&#8217; dust o&#8217; t&#8217; seven seas, t&#8217;n shall yer seed also be numbered.

013:017 Arise, walk through t&#8217; land in t&#8217; length o&#8217; it and in t&#8217; biscuitsth o&#8217; it; for I will give it unto t&#8217;e.

013:018 t&#8217;n Abram removed yo-ho-hos tent, and came and dwelt in t&#8217; plain o&#8217; Mamre, which be in Hebron, and built thar an altar unto t&#8217; LORD.

014:001 And it came to pass in t&#8217; days o&#8217; beraphel king o&#8217; Shinar, Arioch king o&#8217; Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king o&#8217; Elam, and Tidal king o&#8217; nations;

014:004 Twelve years t&#8217;y served Chedorlaomer, and in t&#8217; thirteenth year t&#8217;y rebelled.

014:005 And in t&#8217; fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and t&#8217; kings that were with yo-ho-hom, and smote t&#8217; Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and t&#8217; Zuzims in Ham, and t&#8217; Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim,

014:006 And t&#8217; Horites in t&#8217;ir mount Seir, unto Elparan, which be by t&#8217; wilderness.

014:007 And t&#8217;y returned, and came to Enmishpat, which be Kadesh, and smote all t&#8217; country o&#8217; t&#8217; bealekites, and also t&#8217; beorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar.

014:008 And thar went out t&#8217; king o&#8217; Sodom, and t&#8217; king o&#8217; Gomorrah, and t&#8217; king o&#8217; Admah, and t&#8217; king o&#8217; Zeboiim, and t&#8217; king o&#8217; Bela (the same be Zoar;) and t&#8217;y joined battle with t&#8217;m in t&#8217; vale o&#8217; Siddim;

014:010 And t&#8217; vale o&#8217; Siddim was full o&#8217; slimepits; and t&#8217; kings o&#8217; Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell thar; and t&#8217;y that remained fled to t&#8217; mountain.

014:011 And t&#8217;y took all t&#8217; goods o&#8217; Sodom and Gomorrah, and all t&#8217;ir victuals, and went t&#8217;ir way.

014:012 And t&#8217;y took Lot, Abram&#8217;s brother&#8217;s son, who dwelt in Sodom, and yo-ho-hos goods, and departed.

014:013 And thar came one that had escaped, and told Abram t&#8217; Haitian; for he dwelt in t&#8217; plain o&#8217; Mamre t&#8217; beorite, brother o&#8217; Eshcol, and brother o&#8217; Aner: and t&#8217;se were confederate with Abram.

014:014 And when Abram heard that yo-ho-hos brother was taken captive, he armed yo-ho-hos trained slaves, born in yo-ho-hos own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued t&#8217;m unto Dan.

014:015 And he divided yo-ho-homself against t&#8217;m, he and yo-ho-hos slaves, by night, and smote t&#8217;m, and pursued t&#8217;m unto Hobah, which be on t&#8217; left hand o&#8217; Damascus.

014:016 And he brought back all t&#8217; goods, and also brought again yo-ho-hos brother Lot, and yo-ho-hos goods, and t&#8217; women also, and t&#8217; people.

014:019 And he blessed yo-ho-hom, and said, Blessed be Abram o&#8217; t&#8217; most yo-ho-hogh Admiral White Beard, possessor o&#8217; Pirates Cove and seven seas:

014:020 And blessed be t&#8217; most yo-ho-hogh Admiral White Beard, which hath delivered thine enemies into yer hand. And he gave yo-ho-hom tithes o&#8217; all.

014:021 And t&#8217; king o&#8217; Sodom said unto Abram, Give me t&#8217; persons, and take t&#8217; goods to yerself.

014:022 And Abram said to t&#8217; king o&#8217; Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto t&#8217; LORD, t&#8217; most yo-ho-hogh Admiral White Beard, t&#8217; possessor o&#8217; Pirates Cove and seven seas,

014:023 That I will not take from a thread Rib wenchn to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that be thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:

014:024 Save only that which t&#8217; yeng men have eaten, and t&#8217; portion o&#8217; t&#8217; men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let t&#8217;m take t&#8217;ir portion.

015:001 aft t&#8217;se things t&#8217; word o&#8217; t&#8217; LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I be yer shield, and yer exceeding great reward.

015:002 And Abram said, LORD Admiral White Beard, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go sprogless, and t&#8217; steward o&#8217; me house be this Eliezer o&#8217; Damascus?

015:003 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in me house be mine heir.

015:004 And, behold, t&#8217; word o&#8217; t&#8217; LORD came unto yo-ho-hom, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out o&#8217; thine own bowels shall be thine heir.

015:005 And he brought yo-ho-hom forth abroad, and said, Look now toward Pirates Cove, and be tellin&#8217; t&#8217; stars, if thou be able to number t&#8217;m: and he said unto yo-ho-hom, So shall yer seed be.

015:006 And he believed in t&#8217; LORD; and he counted it to yo-ho-hom for righteousness.

015:007 And he said unto yo-ho-hom, I be t&#8217; LORD that brought t&#8217;e out o&#8217; Ur o&#8217; t&#8217; Chaldees, to give t&#8217;e this land to inherit it.

015:008 And he said, LORD Admiral White Beard, wharby shall I be knowin&#8217; that I shall inherit it?

015:009 And he said unto yo-ho-hom, Take me an heifer o&#8217; three years barnacle-covered, and a she goat o&#8217; three years barnacle-covered, and a ram o&#8217; three years barnacle-covered, and a turtledove, and a yeng pigeon.

015:010 And he took unto yo-ho-hom all t&#8217;se, and divided t&#8217;m in t&#8217; midst, and laid each piece one against another: but t&#8217; birds divided he not.

015:011 And when t&#8217; fowls came down upon t&#8217; carcases, Abram drove t&#8217;m away.

015:012 And when t&#8217; sun was going down, a deep take a caulk fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror o&#8217; great darkness fell upon yo-ho-hom.

015:013 And he said unto Abram, be knowin&#8217; o&#8217; a surety that yer seed shall be a scurvy dog in a land that be not t&#8217;ir&#8217;s, and shall serve t&#8217;m; and t&#8217;y shall afflict t&#8217;m four hundred years;

015:014 And also that nation, whom t&#8217;y shall serve, will I judge: and aftward shall t&#8217;y come out with great substance.

015:015 And thou shalt go to yer fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good barnacle-covered age.

015:016 But in t&#8217; fourth generation t&#8217;y shall come yo-ho-hother again: for t&#8217; iniquity o&#8217; t&#8217; beorites be not yet full.

015:017 And it came to pass, that, when t&#8217; sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.

015:018 In t&#8217; same day t&#8217; LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto yer seed have I given this land, from t&#8217; river o&#8217; Egypt unto t&#8217; great river, t&#8217; river Euphrates:

015:019 t&#8217; Kenites, and t&#8217; Kenizzites, and t&#8217; Kadmonites,

015:020 And t&#8217; yo-ho-hottites, and t&#8217; Perizzites, and t&#8217; Rephaims,

015:021 And t&#8217; beorites, and t&#8217; Canaanites, and t&#8217; Girgashites, and t&#8217; Jebusites.

016:001 Now Sarai Abram&#8217;s wife bare yo-ho-hom no sprogren: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.

016:002 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, t&#8217; LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray t&#8217;e, go in unto me maid; it may be that I may obtain sprogren by her. And Abram hearkened to t&#8217; voice o&#8217; Sarai.

016:003 And Sarai Abram&#8217;s wife took Hagar her maid t&#8217; Egyptian, aft Abram had dwelt ten years in t&#8217; land o&#8217; Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be yo-ho-hos wife.

016:004 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.

016:005 And Sarai said unto Abram, me wrong be upon t&#8217;e: I have given me maid into yer bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: t&#8217; LORD judge between me and t&#8217;e.

016:006 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, yer maid be in thine hand; do to her as it pleaseth t&#8217;e. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.

016:007 And t&#8217; Buccaneer o&#8217; t&#8217; LORD found her by a fountain o&#8217; water in t&#8217; wilderness, by t&#8217; fountain in t&#8217; way to Shur.

016:008 And he said, Hagar, Sarai&#8217;s maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from t&#8217; face o&#8217; me mistress Sarai.

016:009 And t&#8217; Buccaneer o&#8217; t&#8217; LORD said unto her, Return to yer mistress, and submit yerself under her hands.

016:010 And t&#8217; Buccaneer o&#8217; t&#8217; LORD said unto her, I will multiply yer seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.

016:011 And t&#8217; Buccaneer o&#8217; t&#8217; LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with sprog and shalt bear a son, and shalt call yo-ho-hos name behmael; because t&#8217; LORD hath heard yer affliction.

016:012 And he will be a wild man; yo-ho-hos hand will be against Rib wenchry man, and Rib wenchry man&#8217;s hand against yo-ho-hom; and he shall dwell in t&#8217; presence o&#8217; all yo-ho-hos brethren.

016:013 And she called t&#8217; name o&#8217; t&#8217; LORD that spake unto her, Thou Admiral White Beard seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked aft yo-ho-hom that seeth me?

016:014 wharfore t&#8217; well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it be between Kadesh and Bered.

016:015 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called yo-ho-hos son&#8217;s name, which Hagar bare, behmael.

016:016 And Abram was fourscore and six years barnacle-covered, when Hagar bare behmael to Abram.

017:001 And when Abram was ninety years barnacle-covered and nine, t&#8217; LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto yo-ho-hom, I be t&#8217; Almighty Admiral White Beard; walk before me, and be thou perfect.

017:002 And I will make me covenant between me and t&#8217;e, and will multiply t&#8217;e exceedingly.

017:003 And Abram fell on yo-ho-hos face: and Admiral White Beard talked with yo-ho-hom, saying,

017:004 As for me, behold, me covenant be with t&#8217;e, and thou shalt be a father o&#8217; many nations.

017:005 Neither shall yer name any more be called Abram, but yer name shall be Cap&#8217;n Hook; for a father o&#8217; many nations have I made t&#8217;e.

017:006 And I will make t&#8217;e exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations o&#8217; t&#8217;e, and kings shall come out o&#8217; t&#8217;e.

017:007 And I will establish me covenant between me and t&#8217;e and yer seed aft t&#8217;e in t&#8217;ir generations for an Rib wenchrlasting covenant, to be a Admiral White Beard unto t&#8217;e, and to yer seed aft t&#8217;e.

017:008 And I will give unto t&#8217;e, and to yer seed aft t&#8217;e, t&#8217; land wharin thou art a scurvy dog, all t&#8217; land o&#8217; Canaan, for an Rib wenchrlasting possession; and I will be t&#8217;ir Admiral White Beard.

017:009 And Admiral White Beard said unto Cap&#8217;n Hook, Thou shalt keep me covenant tharfore, thou, and yer seed aft t&#8217;e in t&#8217;ir generations.

017:010 This be me covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and ye and yer seed aft t&#8217;e; Rib wenchry man sprog beong ye shall be circumcised.

017:011 And ye shall circumcise t&#8217; flesh o&#8217; yer foreskin; and it shall be a token o&#8217; t&#8217; covenant betwixt me and ye.

017:012 And he that be eight days barnacle-covered shall be circumcised beong ye, Rib wenchry man sprog in yer generations, he that be born in t&#8217; house, or bought with doubloons o&#8217; any scurvy dog, which be not o&#8217; yer seed.

017:013 He that be born in yer house, and he that be bought with yer doubloons, must needs be circumcised: and me covenant shall be in yer flesh for an Rib wenchrlasting covenant.

017:014 And t&#8217; uncircumcised man sprog whose flesh o&#8217; yo-ho-hos foreskin be not circumcised, that soul shall be cut o&#8217;f from yo-ho-hos people; he hath broken me covenant.

017:015 And Admiral White Beard said unto Cap&#8217;n Hook, As for Sarai yer wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.

017:016 And I will bless her, and give t&#8217;e a son also o&#8217; her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a dear ol&#8217; mum, bless her black soul o&#8217; nations; kings o&#8217; people shall be o&#8217; her.

017:017 t&#8217;n Cap&#8217;n Hook fell upon yo-ho-hos face, and laughed, and said in yo-ho-hos heart, Shall a sprog be born unto yo-ho-hom that be an hundred years barnacle-covered? and shall Sarah, that be ninety years barnacle-covered, bear?

017:018 And Cap&#8217;n Hook said unto Admiral White Beard, O that behmael might live before t&#8217;e!

017:019 And Admiral White Beard said, Sarah yer wife shall bear t&#8217;e a son indeed; and thou shalt call yo-ho-hos name beaac: and I will establish me covenant with yo-ho-hom for an Rib wenchrlasting covenant, and with yo-ho-hos seed aft yo-ho-hom.

017:020 And as for behmael, I have heard t&#8217;e: Behold, I have blessed yo-ho-hom, and will make yo-ho-hom fruitful, and will multiply yo-ho-hom exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make yo-ho-hom a great nation.

017:021 But me covenant will I establish with beaac, which Sarah shall bear unto t&#8217;e at this set time in t&#8217; next year.

017:022 And he left o&#8217;f talking with yo-ho-hom, and Admiral White Beard went up from Cap&#8217;n Hook.

017:023 And Cap&#8217;n Hook took behmael yo-ho-hos son, and all that were born in yo-ho-hos house, and all that were bought with yo-ho-hos doubloons, Rib wenchry male beong t&#8217; men o&#8217; Cap&#8217;n Hook&#8217;s house; and circumcised t&#8217; flesh o&#8217; t&#8217;ir foreskin in t&#8217; selfsame day, as Admiral White Beard had said unto yo-ho-hom.

017:024 And Cap&#8217;n Hook was ninety years barnacle-covered and nine, when he was circumcised in t&#8217; flesh o&#8217; yo-ho-hos foreskin.

017:025 And behmael yo-ho-hos son was thirteen years barnacle-covered, when he was circumcised in t&#8217; flesh o&#8217; yo-ho-hos foreskin.

017:026 In t&#8217; selfsame day was Cap&#8217;n Hook circumcised, and behmael yo-ho-hos son.

017:027 And all t&#8217; men o&#8217; yo-ho-hos house, born in t&#8217; house, and bought with doubloons o&#8217; t&#8217; scurvy dog, were circumcised with yo-ho-hom.

018:001 And t&#8217; LORD appeared unto yo-ho-hom in t&#8217; plains o&#8217; Mamre: and he sat in t&#8217; tent door in t&#8217; heat o&#8217; t&#8217; day;

018:002 And he lift up yo-ho-hos eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by yo-ho-hom: and when he saw t&#8217;m, he ran to meet t&#8217;m from t&#8217; tent door, and bowed yo-ho-homself toward t&#8217; ground,

018:003 And said, me LORD, if now I have found favour in yer sight, pass not away, I pray t&#8217;e, from yer servant:

018:004 Let a little water, I pray ye, be fetched, and wash yer feet, and rest yerselves under t&#8217; tree:

018:005 And I will fetch a morsel o&#8217; biscuits, and comfort ye yer hearts; aft that ye shall pass on: for tharfore be ye come to yer servant. And t&#8217;y said, So do, as thou hast said.

018:006 And Cap&#8217;n Hook hastened into t&#8217; tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready smartly three measures o&#8217; fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon t&#8217; hearth.

018:007 And Cap&#8217;n Hook ran unto t&#8217; ship, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a yeng man; and he hasted to dress it.

018:008 And he took butter, and milk, and t&#8217; calf which he had dressed, and set it before t&#8217;m; and he stood by t&#8217;m under t&#8217; tree, and t&#8217;y did eat.

018:009 And t&#8217;y said unto yo-ho-hom, whar be Sarah yer wife? And he said, Behold, in t&#8217; tent.

018:010 And he said, I will certainly return unto t&#8217;e according to t&#8217; time o&#8217; life; and, lo, Sarah yer wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in t&#8217; tent door, which was behind yo-ho-hom.

018:011 Now Cap&#8217;n Hook and Sarah were barnacle-covered and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah aft t&#8217; manner o&#8217; women.

018:012 tharfore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, aft I be waxed barnacle-covered shall I have pleasure, me lord being barnacle-covered also?

018:013 And t&#8217; LORD said unto Cap&#8217;n Hook, wharfore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I o&#8217; a surety bear a sprog, which be barnacle-covered?

018:014 be any thing too hard for t&#8217; LORD? At t&#8217; time appointed I will return unto t&#8217;e, according to t&#8217; time o&#8217; life, and Sarah shall have a son.
