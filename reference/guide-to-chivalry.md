### Greg&#8217;s Guide to Chivalry

Chivalry refers to the medieval institution of knightly virtues, of honour, and of courtly love. A noble man followed an unwritten code of chivalry toward noble ladies above all, the knight was to be gracious and gentle. The idealized relationship between knight and lady was that of honourable and virtuous courtly love.

### Greg&#8217;s Code of Chivalry

Chivalry was disciplined by a code of conduct that was clearly understood although it was never clearly formulated. Examination now, in retrospect, allows it to be reduced to this series of commandments.

<!-- ### Greg&#8217;s Guide to Practical Chivalry

When ladies are present, so should there be gentlemen, especially in this age.

  * A gentleman always defend the honour of a lady. (i.e. if an unhonourably gentleman disrespects a sentient being it is the responsibility of a gentleman to restore their honour)
  * A gentleman always respect a lady. (i.e. he should only speak honourably of her)
  * A gentleman always take a route that is most suitable for the lady. (i.e. a cab ride instead of walking 2 miles in the rain)
  * When walking down a foot path with a lady a gentleman will walk on the side closest to the road but when there is no road the lady is always on the non master arm of her gentleman so he is able to better protect her.
  * When entering or exiting a room a gentleman will hold open the door for the lady and allow her to pass first unless the gentleman is concerned for her safety.
  * A gentleman should be accustomed to standing for a lady when she does. (i.e. if a lady stands at a table for instance so should a gentleman)
  * A gentleman orders for his lady at a restaurant.
  * A gentleman is responsible for the comfort of the lady. (i.e. he will give up his coat to keep her warm)
  * A lady will always feel special in the company of a gentleman.
  * The correct answer to a lady from a gentleman is always a compliment.
  * A gentleman will not only respect a lady but also the family of that lady. (i.e. he will ask her father for her hand in marriage)
  * A lady should never have to open her own door or pour her own glass of wine while in the presence of a man. -->
